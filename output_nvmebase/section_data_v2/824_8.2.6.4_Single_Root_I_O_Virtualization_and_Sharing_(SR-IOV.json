    "text": "The PCI-SIG® PCI Express Base specification defines Single Root I/O Virtualization and Sharing\nSpecification (SR-IOV) extensions to PCI Express that allow multiple System Images (SIs), such as virtual\nmachines running on a hypervisor, to share PCI hardware resources. The primary benefit of SR-IOV is that\nit eliminates the hypervisor from participating in I/O operations which may be a significant factor limiting\nstorage performance in some virtualized environments and allows direct SI access to PCI hardware\nresources.\nA Physical Function (PF) is a PCI Express Function that supports the SR-IOV Capability, which in turn\nallows that PF to support one or more dependent Virtual Functions (VFs). These PFs and VFs may support\nNVM Express controllers that share an underlying NVM subsystem with multi-path I/O and namespace\nsharing capabilities (refer to section 2.4.1).\nSR-IOV Virtual Functions (VFs) with an NVM Express Class Code (refer to the PCI Header section of the\nNVMe over PCIe Transport Specification) shall implement fully compliant NVM Express controllers. This\nensures that the same host software developed for non-virtualized environments is capable of running\nunmodified within an SI.\nFor hosts where SR-IOV is unsupported or not needed, a controller that is a PF shall support operation as\na stand-alone controller.\nFor a controller that is a PF, the requirements for SR-IOV Capability registers VF BAR0, VF BAR1, VF\nBAR2, VF BAR4, and VF BAR5 are the same as the requirements for PCI registers BAR0, BAR1, BAR4,\nand BAR5, respectively. For a controller that is a PF, SR-IOV Capability register VF BAR2 shall not support\nIndex/Data Pair. Refer to the PCI Header section of the NVMe over PCIe Transport Specification.\nTo accommodate SR-IOV address range isolation requirements, VF BAR2 and VF BAR3 may support a\n64-bit prefetchable memory register space which shall only be used for MSI-X Tables and MSI-X PBAs of\nVFs. MSI-X Table BIR = ‘2’ and MSI-X PBA BIR = ‘2’ are valid for controllers that are VFs. Refer to the\nMSI-X Capability section of the NVMe over PCIe Transport Specification.\nWhile the controller properties of a controller that is a VF are accessible only if SR-IOV Control.VF MSE is\nset to ‘1’, clearing VF MSE from ‘1’ to ‘0’ does not cause a reset of that controller. In this case, controller\nproperties are hidden, but their values are not reset.",
