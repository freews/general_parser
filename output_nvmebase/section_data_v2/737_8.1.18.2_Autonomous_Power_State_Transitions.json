    "text": "The controller may support autonomous power state transitions, as indicated in the Identify Controller data\nstructure in Figure 328. Autonomous power state transitions provide a mechanism for the host to configure\nthe controller to automatically transition between power states on certain conditions without software\nintervention.\nThe entry condition to transition to the Idle Transition Power State is that the controller has been in idle for\na continuous period of time exceeding the Idle Time Prior to Transition time specified. The controller is idle\nwhen there are no commands outstanding to any I/O Submission Queue. If a controller has an operation in\nprocess (e.g., device self-test operation) that would cause controller power to exceed that advertised for\nthe proposed non-operational power state, then the controller should not autonomously transition to that\nstate.\nThe power state to transition to shall be a non-operational power state (a non-operational power state may\nautonomously transition to another non-operational power state). If an operational power state is specified\nby a Set Features command specifying the Autonomous Power State Transitions feature (i.e., the Feature\nIdentifier field set to 0Ch (refer to section 5.2.26.1.6), then the controller should abort the command with a\nstatus code of Invalid Field in Command. Refer to section 8.1.18.1 for more details.",
