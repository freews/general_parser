    "text": "This Feature indicates the number of queues that the host requests for the controller processing the\ncommand. This Feature shall only be issued during initialization prior to creation of any I/O Submission\nand/or Completion Queues. If a Set Features command is issued for this Feature after creation of any I/O\nSubmission and/or I/O Completion Queues, then the Set Features command shall abort with status code\nof Command Sequence Error. The controller shall not change the value allocated between resets. For a\nSet Features command, the attributes are specified in Command Dword 11 (refer to Figure 472). For a Get\nFeatures command, Dword 11 is ignored.\nIf a Set Features or Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure\n473 are returned in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.\nNote: The value allocated may be smaller or larger than the number of queues requested, often in virtualized\nimplementations. The controller may not have as many queues to allocate as are requested. Alternatively,\nthe controller may have an allocation unit of queues (e.g., power of two) and may supply more queues to\nthe host to satisfy its allocation unit.",
