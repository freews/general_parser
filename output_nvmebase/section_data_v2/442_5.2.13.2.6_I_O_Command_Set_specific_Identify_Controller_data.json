If the I/O\nCommand Set specified by the CSI field does not have an Identify Controller data structure, then the\ncontroller shall return a zero filled data structure. If the host requests a data structure for an I/O Command\nSet that the controller does not support, the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid\nField in Command.",
