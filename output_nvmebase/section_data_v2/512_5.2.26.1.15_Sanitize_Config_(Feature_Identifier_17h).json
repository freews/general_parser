The scope of this Feature\nis the NVM subsystem.\nThe attributes are specified in Command Dword 11.\nIf a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure 427 are returned\nin Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.\nIf this Feature is not saveable (refer to Figure 199), then the default value of the NODRM attribute shall be\ncleared to ‘0’ (i.e., No-Deallocate Error Response Mode).\nIf the capabilities of the Sanitize Config Feature Identifier are both changeable and saveable (refer to\nsection 4.4), then the host is able to configure this Feature when initially provisioning a device.",
