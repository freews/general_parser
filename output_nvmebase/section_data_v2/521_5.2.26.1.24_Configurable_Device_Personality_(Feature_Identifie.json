    "text": "This Feature controls the operation of the Configurable Device Personality (CDP) capability (refer to section\n8.1.6). The Set Features command allows a host to change the settings of a device personality in the NVM\nsubsystem and the Get Features command allows a host to discover the settings for a device personality.\nFigure 447 defines personalities that are able to be supported by an NVM subsystem. Each personality\nmay have multiple configurations.\nThe attributes for this Feature are specified in Command Dword 13 (refer to Figure 448). The effects on an\nNVM subsystem as a result of making a change to the settings of the specified personality are described\nin section 8.1.6.\nThe Set Features command and the Get Features command may transfer additional data in the command\ndata buffer as defined by each personality (refer to Figure 447).\nIf a Get Features command completes successfully for this Feature, then:\n•\nthe current attributes for the personality specified by the PERID field in that Get Features command\nshall be returned in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command (refer to Figure 449);\nand\n•\nif the personality specified in the PERID field in Command Dword 13 defines settings in the data\nbuffer (as indicated in Figure 447), then those personality settings shall correspond to the current\nsettings for that personality.\nIf a personality that is not supported (refer to Figure 285) is specified in the PERID field in Command Dword\n13, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.\nIf the personality (i.e., the PERID field in Command Dword 13) is set to the All Personalities value (i.e., FFh)\nand the Change Personality Settings (CHPS) bit is set to ‘1’ for a Set Features command, then the controller\nshall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.\nThis Feature is not saveable and is persistent (refer to Figure 396). The settings for each personality shall\npersist across power cycles and resets unless modified by the mechanisms described in this section.\nA personality is able to be frozen. If a personality is frozen, then the settings of that personality are not\nallowed to be changed. If an authentication method is supported by that personality, as described in section\n5.2.26.1.24.1, then that frozen personality is able to be unfrozen. If no authentication method is supported\nby that personality, then that frozen personality is permanently frozen.\nNVM Express does not provide any guidance on whether modifying the NVM subsystem by changing the\nsettings of a personality affects compliance with any applicable laws, specifications, or other requirements.",
