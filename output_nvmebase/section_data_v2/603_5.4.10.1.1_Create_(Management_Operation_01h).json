    "text": "The Create operation of the Manage Exported Port command is used to create an Exported Port in an\nExported NVM Subsystem and associate the Exported Port with an Underlying Port in the Ports List. The\nresulting association enables the specified Exported NVM Subsystem to be accessed by hosts through the\nspecified Exported Port. The Exported Port ID for the Exported Port that is created may be specified by the\nhost or generated by the controller.\nThe data pointer shall point to an Create data structure (refer to Figure 564).\nUpon successful completion of a Manage Exported Port command with a Create operation, Dword 0 of the\ncompletion queue entry of the Manage Exported Port command contains the Exported Port ID associated\nwith the Exported NVM Subsystem (refer to Figure 565).\nIf the Exported NVM Subsystem NVMe Qualified Name field specified in the Create Data Structure does\nnot identify an existing Exported NVM Subsystem, then the controller shall abort the command with a status\ncode of Invalid Field in Command.\nIf the Generate Exported Port ID bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the Create data structure indicating an Exported Port\nID is specified in the Manage Exported Port data structure and used to identify the new Exported Port; and:\n•\nan Exported Port ID is not specified in the Manage Exported Port data structure in the data buffer;\nor\n•\nan Exported Port ID specified in the data buffer does not uniquely identify an Exported NVM\nSubsystem Port (i.e., if the specified Exported Port ID is used to identify an already existing\nExported NVM Subsystem Port),\nthen the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.",
