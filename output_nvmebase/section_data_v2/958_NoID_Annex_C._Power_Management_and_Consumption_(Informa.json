    "text": "NVM Express power management capabilities allow the host to manage power for a controller. Power\nmanagement includes both control and reporting mechanisms.\nFor information on transport power management (e.g., PCIe, RDMA), refer to the applicable NVM Express\nTransport specification.\nThe scope of NVM Express power management is the controller (refer to section 5.2.26.1.2).\nNVM Express power management uses the following functionality:\na) Features:\n•\nPower Management (refer to section 5.2.26.1.2 and section 8.1.18);\n•\nAutonomous Power State Transition (refer to section 5.2.26.1.6 and section 8.1.18.2);\n•\nNon-Operational Power State Configuration (refer to section 5.2.26.1.10 and section 8.1.18.1);\nand\n•\nSpinup Control (refer to section 5.2.26.1.18);\nNVM subsystem workloads (refer to 8 1 18 3); and\nb) NVM subsystem workloads (refer to 8.1.18.3); and\nc)\nRuntime D3 transitions (refer to section 8.1.18.4).\nController thermal management may cause a transition to a lower power state, interacting with these\nFeatures:\na) Temperature Threshold (refer to section 5.2.26.1.3);\nb) Host Controlled Thermal Management (refer to section 5.2.26.1.9 and section 8.1.18.5); and\nc) access to host memory buffer (refer to section 5.2.26.2.4) may be prohibited in non-operational\npower state.\nNVM Express power management uses these reporting mechanisms:\na) properties:\n•\nController Power Scope (CAP.CPS) (refer to Figure 36);\nb) fields in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328):\n•\nRTD3 Resume Latency (RTD3R);\n•\nRTD3 Entry Latency (RTD3E);\n•\nNon-Operational Power State Permissive Mode;\n•\nNumber of Power States Support (NPSS);\n•\nAutonomous Power State Transition Attributes (APSTA); and\n•\nPower State 0 Descriptor (PSD0) through Power State 31 Descriptor (PSD31) (refer to Figure\n329);\nc) Features:\n•\nPower Management (refer to section 5.2.26.1.2);\n•\nTemperature Threshold (refer to section 5.2.26.1.3);\n•\nAutonomous Power State Transition (refer to section 5.2.26.1.6 and section 8.1.18.2);\n•\nNon-Operational Power State Configuration (refer to section 5.2.26.1.10 and section 8.1.18.1);\n•\nHost Controlled Thermal Management (refer to section 5.2.26.1.9 and section 8.1.18.5);\n•\nHost Memory Buffer (refer to section5.2.26.2.4); and\n•\nSpinup Control (refer to section 5.2.26.1.18);\nand\nd) log pages:\n•\nSMART / Health Information log page fields (refer to section 5.2.12.1.3):\nThermal Management Temperature [1-2] Transition Count; and\nTotal Time For Thermal Management Temperature [1-2];\nand\n•\nPersistent Event Log fields (refer to section 5.2.12.1.14):",
