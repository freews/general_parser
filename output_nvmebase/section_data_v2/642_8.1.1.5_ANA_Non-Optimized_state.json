Commands processed by a controller that\nreports this state for an ANA Group provide non-optimized access characteristics (e.g., the processing of\nsome commands, especially those involving data transfer, may operate with lower performance or may use\nNVM subsystem resources less effectively than if a controller is used that reports the optimized state) to\nany namespace in that ANA Group. Support for reporting this state is optional.\nWhile in this state, all commands, functions, and operations supported by the namespace shall perform as\ndescribed in this specification.",
