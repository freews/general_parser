    "text": "A sanitize operation alters all user data in the sanitization target such that recovery of any previous user\ndata is prohibitively difficult (i.e., infeasible for a given level of effort (refer to IEEE Std 2883)). The scope\nof a sanitize operation is different for an NVM subsystem sanitize operation (refer to section 1.5.70) and for\na namespace sanitize operation (refer to section 1.5.65) as shown in Figure 704.\nPerforming a namespace sanitize operation on every namespace that exists in the NVM subsystem does\nnot have the same effect upon certain portions of data in the NVM subsystem as performing an NVM\nsubsystem sanitize operation (e.g., namespace sanitize operations have no effect on the Controller Memory\nBuffer). If a namespace sanitize operation has been performed on every namespace that exists in the NVM\nsubsystem and no user data has been written to any of those namespaces since each namespace sanitize\noperation completed successfully, then the Global Data Erased bit (refer to Figure 302) in the Sanitize\nStatus log page for the sanitization target of the NVM subsystem shall not be set ‘1’ as a result of\nsuccessfully completing those namespace sanitize operations.\nFor an NVM subsystem sanitize operation, it is implementation specific whether Submission Queues and\nCompletion Queues within a Controller Memory Buffer are altered; all other data stored in all Controller\nMemory Buffers is altered by that NVM subsystem sanitize operation. If a portion of the user data, that was\nrequired to be altered, was not altered and the NVM subsystem sanitize operation completed successfully,\nthen the NVM subsystem shall ensure permanent inaccessibility of that portion of the media in the NVM\nsubsystem that is allocated for user data for any future use within the NVM subsystem (e.g., retrieval from\nNVM media, caches, or any Controller Memory Buffer) and permanent inaccessibility of that portion of the\nmedia in the NVM subsystem that is allocated for user data via any interface to the NVM subsystem,\nincluding management interfaces as defined by the NVM Express Management Interface Specification.\nIf the composition of the NVM subsystem (refer to section 3.2.5) changes (e.g., a new domain is added, or\na division event occurs) and that change prevents the successful completion of a sanitize operation, then\nthe sanitize operation shall fail. If the composition of the NVM subsystem changes and that change does\nnot prevent the successful completion of a sanitize operation, then that NVM subsystem composition\nchange does not cause the sanitize operation to fail.\nIf the composition of the NVM subsystem changes (e.g., a new domain is added, or a division event occurs)\nand that change prevents verification of media in the sanitization target that is allocated for user data, then\nthe Media Verification state is canceled and the MVCNCLD bit is set to ‘1’.\nSanitize operations do not affect the Replay Protected Memory Block, boot partitions, or other media and\ncaches that do not contain user data. A sanitize operation also may alter log pages and features as\nnecessary (e.g., to prevent derivation of user data from log page information or feature information). A\nsanitize operation is only able to be started if the NVM subsystem does not have a division (refer to section\n3.2.5) that prevents successfully processing a sanitize operation (refer to section 8.1.26.1). A sanitize\noperation in the Restricted Processing state, the Unrestricted Processing state, the Media Verification state,\nor the Post-Verification Deallocation state is not able to be aborted and continues after a Controller Level\nReset, including across power cycles. Refer to Annex A for further information about sanitize operations.",
