    "text": "This log page may be used to determine the current window for the specified NVM Set when Predictable\nLatency Mode is enabled and any events that have occurred for the specified NVM Set. There is one log\npage for each NVM Set when Predictable Latency Mode is supported. The NVM Set for which the log page\nis to be returned is specified in the Log Specific Identifier field in Command Dword 11 of the Get Log Page\ncommand as defined in Figure 223. The log page is 512 bytes in size.\nThe log page indicates typical values and reliable estimates for attributes associated with the Deterministic\nWindow and the Non-Deterministic Window of the specified NVM Set. The Typical, Maximum, and Minimum\nvalues are static and worst-case values over the lifetime of the NVM subsystem.\nAfter the controller successfully completes a read of this log page with Retain Asynchronous Event bit\ncleared to ‘0’, then reported events are cleared to ‘0’ for the specified NVM Set and the field corresponding\nto the specified NVM Set is cleared to ‘0’ in the Predictable Latency Event Aggregate log page. Co-\nordination between two or more hosts is beyond the scope of this specification.",
