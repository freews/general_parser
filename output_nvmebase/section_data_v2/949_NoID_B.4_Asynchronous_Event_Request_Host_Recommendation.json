    "text": "This section describes the recommended the host procedure for Asynchronous Event Requests\nThe host sends n Asynchronous Event Request commands (refer to section 3.5.1, step 12). When an\nAsynchronous Event Request completes (providing Event Type, Event Information, and Log Page details):\n•\nIf the event(s) in the reported Log Page may be disabled with the Asynchronous Event\nConfiguration feature (refer to section 5.2.26.1.5), then the host issues a Set Features command\nfor the Asynchronous Event Configuration feature specifying to disable reporting of all events that\nutilize the Log Page reported. The host should wait for the Set Features command to complete;\n•\nThe host issues a Get Log Page command requesting the Log Page reported as part of the\nAsynchronous Event Command completion. The host should wait for the Get Log Page command\nto complete;\n•\nThe host parses the returned Log Page. If the condition is not persistent, then the host should re-\nenable all asynchronous events that utilize the Log Page. If the condition is persistent, then the\nhost should re-enable all asynchronous events that utilize the Log Page except for the one(s)\nreported in the Log Page. The host re-enables events by issuing a Set Features command for the\nAsynchronous Event Configuration feature;\n•\nThe host should issue an Asynchronous Event Request command to the controller (restoring to n\nthe number of these commands outstanding); and\n•\nIf the reporting of event(s) was disabled, the host should enable reporting of the event(s) using the\nAsynchronous Event Configuration feature. If the condition reported may persist, the host should\ncontinue to monitor the event (e.g., spare below threshold) to determine if reporting of the event\nshould be re-enabled.",
