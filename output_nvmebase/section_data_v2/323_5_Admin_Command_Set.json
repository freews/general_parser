Section 5.3 describes\nAdmin commands that are specific to the Memory-based transport model. Section 5.4 describes Admin\ncommands that are specific to the Message-based transport model.\nThe submission queue entry (SQE) structure and the fields that are common to all Admin commands are\ndefined in section 4.1. The completion queue entry (CQE) structure and the fields that are common to all\nAdmin commands are defined in section 4.2. The command specific fields in the SQE and CQE structures\n(i.e., SQE Command Dwords 10 to 15, CQE Dword 0, and CQE Dword 1) for the Admin Command Set are\ndefined in this section.\nAdmin commands should not be impacted by the state of I/O queues (e.g., a full I/O Completion Queue\nshould not delay or stall the Delete I/O Submission Queue command).\nFigure 142 defines all Admin commands.
