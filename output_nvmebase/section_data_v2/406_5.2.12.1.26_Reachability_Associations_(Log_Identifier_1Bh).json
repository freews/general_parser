    "text": "This log page consists of a header describing the log page and a list of descriptors containing the\nReachability Associations (refer to section 8.1.21), for the controller processing the Get Log Page command\nrequesting the Reachability Associations log page, that contain Reachability Groups (refer 5.2.12.1.25) that\nall have the same reachability attributes.\nIf the Index Offset Supported bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the LID Support and Effects data structure for this log\npage (refer to Figure 208), then:\n•\nif the RAO bit is cleared to ‘0’ in Command Dword 10, then the LPOL field in Command Dword 12\nand the LPOU field in Command Dword 13 of the Get Log Page command should be cleared to\n0h.\nIf the Index Offset Supported bit is set to ‘1’ in the LID Supported and Effects data structure for this log page\n(refer to Figure 208), then:\n•\nfor indexes greater than 0, the entry data structure that is indexed is a Reachability Association\ndescriptor (e.g., specifying an index offset of 2 returns this log page starting at the second descriptor\n(i.e., Reachability Association Descriptor 1)).\nIf the host performs multiple Get Log Page commands to read this log page (e.g., using the LPOL field or\nthe LPOU field), then the host should re-read the header of the log page and ensure that the Change Count\nfield in this log page matches the original value read. If it does not match, then the data captured is not\nconsistent and this log page should be re-read.\nThe Log Specific Parameter field in Command Dword 10 (refer to Figure 201) for this log page is defined\nin Figure 281.",
