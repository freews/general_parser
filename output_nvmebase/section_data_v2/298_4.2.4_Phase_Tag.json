    "text": "The Phase Tag bit indicates whether a completion queue entry is new. The Phase Tag bit for each\ncompletion queue entry in:\n•\nthe Admin Completion Queue shall be initialized to ‘0’ by the host prior to setting CC.EN (refer to\nFigure 41) to ‘1’; and\n•\nan I/O Completion Queue shall be initialized to ‘0’ by the host prior to submitting the Create I/O\nCompletion Queue command for that queue.\nWhen the controller posts a new completion queue entry to the Completion Queue, the controller shall\ninvert the Phase Tag bit in that completion queue entry (i.e., the inverting of the Phase Tag bit enables the\nhost to detect the new completion queue entry).\nWhen a completion queue entry is posted to a completion queue slot in:\n•\nthe Admin Completion Queue for the first time after CC.EN is set to ‘1’, the Phase Tag bit for that\ncompletion queue entry is set to ‘1’; and\n•\nan I/O Completion Queue for the first time after the Create I/O Completion Queue command\ncompleted for that queue, the Phase Tag bit for that completion queue entry is set to ‘1’.\nThis continues for each completion queue entry that is posted until the controller posts a completion queue\nentry to the highest numbered completion queue slot and wraps to completion queue slot number 0 as\ndescribed in section 3.3.1.2. When that queue wrap condition occurs, the Phase Tag bit is then cleared to\n‘0’ in each completion queue entry that is posted. This continues until another queue wrap condition occurs.\nEach time a queue wrap condition occurs, the value of the Phase Tag bit is inverted (i.e., changes from ‘1’\nto ‘0’ or changes from ‘0’ to ‘1’).",
