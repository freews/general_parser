    "text": "The Sanitize Status log page is used to report sanitize operation time estimates and information about the\nmost recent sanitize operation (refer to section 8.1.26) for the specified sanitization target.\nThe Get Log Page command returns a data buffer containing a log page formatted as defined in Figure\n302. This log page shall be retained across power cycles and resets. If the controller is not able to report\nvalid data (e.g., due to a division event that prevents reporting sanitize status information), then the Get\nLog Page command shall be aborted with a status code of Controller Pathing Error. If a Get Log Page\ncommand is aborted with a status code of Controller Pathing Error, then submitting a subsequent Get Log\nPage command to a controller with a different domain identifier and requesting the same Sanitize Status\nlog page may be successful. If the controller is able to report valid data, then this log page shall contain\nvalid data whenever CSTS.RDY is set to ‘1’.\nIf the Sanitize Capabilities (SANICAP) field in the Identify Controller data structure is not cleared to 0h (i.e.,\nthe Sanitize command is supported), then this log page shall be supported. If the Sanitize Capabilities field\nin the Identify Controller data structure is cleared to 0h, then this log page is reserved.\nIf the Sanitize Namespace command is supported, then this log page shall support setting the NSID field\nto the value of an allocated NSID.\nThe NSID field in the Get Log Page command specifies the sanitization target for the requested Sanitize\nStatus log page (i.e., whether the scope of the Sanitize Status log page is the NVM subsystem or a\nnamespace). If the NSID field is set to:\n•\n0h or is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the Sanitize Status log page for the NVM subsystem is requested;\nor\n•\nan allocated NSID, then the Sanitize Status log page for the namespace indicated by the NSID is\nrequested.\nIf the NSID specified in the NSID field specifies an unallocated NSID, then the command shall be aborted\nwith a status code of Invalid Namespace or Format.\nIf the NSID field specifies a namespace as the sanitization target and an NVM subsystem sanitize operation\nis in progress, then the command shall be aborted with a status code of Sanitize In Progress.\nIf the NSID field specifies a namespace as the sanitization target and the NVM subsystem is in the\nRestricted Failure state or the Unrestricted Failure state, then the command shall be aborted with a status\ncode of Sanitize Failed.",
