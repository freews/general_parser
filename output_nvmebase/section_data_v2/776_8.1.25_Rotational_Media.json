    "text": "Rotational media has different operational, endurance and performance characteristics than non-rotational\nmedia (e.g., NAND). Rotational media utilizes electromechanical methods for accessing data.\nRotational media contains one or more spinning platters containing the media, and one or more actuators\nthat provide physical access to the data on that media (e.g., a hard disk drive or a CD-ROM).\nA controller that supports namespaces that store user data on rotational media shall:\na) set the Rotational Media bit to ‘1’ in the NSFEAT field of the I/O Command Set Independent Identify\nNamespace data structure (refer to the NVM Express NVM Command Set Specification) for any\nnamespace that stores data on rotational media;\nb) support the Rotational Media Information log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.22);\nc) support the Spinup Control feature (refer to section 5.2.26.1.18);\nd) support Endurance Groups (refer to section 3.2.3); and\ne) set the EG Rotational Media bit to ‘1’ in the EGFEAT field in the Endurance Group Information log\npage for each Endurance Group that stores data on rotational media.\nIf a namespace that stores data on rotational media is attached to a controller, and the spindle used by that\nnamespace is not spinning, then that controller shall be in a non-operational power state (i.e., NOPS is set\nto ‘1’, refer to Figure 329).\nIf:\na) a domain contains an Endurance Group that stores data on rotational media;\nb) that domain processes an NVM Subsystem Reset; and\nc) the Spinup Control feature (refer to section 5.2.26.1.18) is:\na. disabled, then initial spinup for all such Endurance Groups in that domain shall be initiated;\nand\nb. enabled, then initial spinup for all such Endurance Groups in that domain shall be inhibited\nduring processing of the NVM Subsystem Reset until any controller within that domain\nprocesses a Set Features (Power Management) command that specifies an operational\npower state.\nIf the PCIe transport is used for a controller, then the PCIe Slot Power Control feature may affect the power\nstates supported (refer to the PCI Express Base Specification).",
