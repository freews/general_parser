    "text": "After a command has been submitted to the controller (refer to section 1.5.19), the controller transfers\nsubmitted commands into the controller for subsequent processing using a vendor specific algorithm.\nA command is being processed when the controller and/or namespace state is being accessed or modified\nby the command such as:\n•\na Feature setting is being accessed;\n•\na Feature setting is being modified;\n•\nuser data (e.g., a logical block as defined by the NVM Express NVM Command Set Specification)\nis being accessed; or\n•\nuser data is being modified.\nA command is completed when a completion queue entry for the command has been posted to the\ncorresponding Completion Queue. Upon completion, all controller state and/or namespace state\nmodifications made by that command are globally visible to all subsequently submitted commands.\nA candidate command is a submitted command which has been transferred into the controller that the\ncontroller deems ready for processing. The controller selects command(s) for processing from the pool of\nsubmitted commands for each Submission Queue. The commands that comprise a fused operation shall\nbe processed together and in order by the controller. The controller may select candidate commands for\nprocessing in any order. The order in which commands are selected for processing does not imply the order\nin which commands are completed.\nArbitration is the method used to determine the Submission Queue from which the controller starts\nprocessing the next candidate command(s). Once a Submission Queue is selected using arbitration, the\nArbitration Burst setting determines the maximum number of commands that the controller may start\nprocessing from that Submission Queue before arbitration shall again take place. A fused operation may\nbe considered as one or two commands by the controller.\nAll controllers shall support the round robin command arbitration mechanism. A controller may optionally\nimplement weighted round robin with urgent priority class and/or a vendor specific arbitration mechanism.\nThe Arbitration Mechanism Supported field in the Controller Capabilities property (CC.AMS) indicates\noptional arbitration mechanisms supported by the controller.\nIn order to make efficient use of the non-volatile memory, it is often advantageous to execute multiple\ncommands from a Submission Queue in parallel. For Submission Queues that are using weighted round\nrobin with urgent priority class or round robin arbitration, a host may configure an Arbitration Burst setting.\nThe Arbitration Burst setting indicates the maximum number of commands that the controller may launch\nat one time from a particular Submission Queue. It is recommended that a host configure the Arbitration\nBurst setting as close to the recommended value by the controller as possible (specified in the\nRecommended Arbitration Burst field of the Identify Controller data structure in Figure 328), taking into\nconsideration any latency requirements.
