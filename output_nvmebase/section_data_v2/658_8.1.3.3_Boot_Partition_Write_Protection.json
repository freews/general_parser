    "text": "A controller that supports both Boot Partitions and RPMB shall support at least one of the following Boot\nPartition write protection mechanisms:\n•\nSet Features Boot Partition Write Protection (refer to section 8.1.3.3.1); or\n•\nRPMB Boot Partition Write Protection (refer to section 8.1.3.3.2).\nIt is not recommended that a controller support both Set Features Boot Partition Write Protection and RPMB\nBoot Partition Write Protection.\nA controller that supports Boot Partitions and does not support RPMB shall support Set Features Boot\nPartition Write Protection.\nA host is able to determine whether Set Features Boot Partition Write Protection is supported by checking\nthe value of the Set Features Boot Partition Write Protection Support bit of the Boot Partition Capabilities\nfield in the Identify Controller Data Structure (refer to Figure 328).\nA host is able to determine whether RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection is supported by checking the\nRPMB Boot Partition Write Protection Support field of the Boot Partition Capabilities field in the Identify\nController data structure (refer to Figure 328). Only controllers compliant with NVM Express Base\nSpecification, Revision 2.0 and earlier are allowed to report a value of 00b (i.e., support not specified) in\nthat field. If a controller reports the 00b value, a host is able to determine if RPMB Boot Partition Write\nProtection is supported by checking whether the controller supports both Boot Partitions (refer to section\n3.1.4.1) and RPMB (refer to section 5.2.13.2.1) because a controller compliant with NVM Express Base\nSpecification, Revision 2.0 and earlier is required to support RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection when\nthe controller supports both Boot Partitions and RPMB.\nIf Set Features Boot Partition Write Protection is supported and either:\nthen the Boot Partition write protection states are able to be configured via the Boot Partition Write\nProtection Config feature. Section 8.1.3.3.1 covers the case when only the Boot Partition Write Protection\nConfig feature is supported.\nIf RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection is supported and enabled, then the Boot Partition write protection\nstates are able to be configured using RPMB (refer to section 8.1.23). Section 8.1.3.3.2 covers the case\nwhere only RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection is supported.\nOnly one mechanism controls the Boot Partition write protection states at a time. Section 8.1.3.3.3 covers\nconsiderations when both Boot Partition write protection mechanisms are supported.\nIf any Boot Partition is shared across multiple controllers (refer to section 8.1.3), then the write protection\nstate of the Boot Partition shall be enforced by all controllers that share that Boot Partition.",
