    "text": "Exported Resource Management is a capability that may be supported in an NVM subsystem that only\ncontains controllers that use transports other than the Memory-Based Transport Model (e.g., the PCIe\ntransport).\nExporting an Underlying Namespace may be achieved by:\n•\ncreating an Exported NVM Subsystem (refer to section 5.4.2);\n•\nassigning an Underlying Namespace to an Exported NVM Subsystem (refer to section 5.4.8.1.1);\n•\nattaching a transport to the Exported NVM Subsystem to enable remote access to the Exported\nNVM Subsystem (refer to section 5.4.10.1.1); and\n•\noptionally assigning access control policies for the Exported NVM Subsystem (refer to sections\n5.4.9.1.3 and 5.4.9.1.4).\nExported NVM Subsystems shall not expose information about Underlying NVM Subsystem resources or\nentities that are not associated with Exported NVM Subsystem entities. This includes entities in Underlying\nNVM Subsystems (e.g., NSID, NVM Set Identifiers, ANA Group Identifiers).",
