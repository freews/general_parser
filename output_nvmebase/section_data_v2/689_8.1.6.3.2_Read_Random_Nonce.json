    "text": "The random nonce is a random byte string that:\n•\nshall be generated by the controller; and\n•\nshall be stored for later use with Programmable Key Authentication (refer to section\n5.2.26.1.24.1.2).\nThe size of the random nonce is vendor specific.\nA host is able to obtain the random nonce by submitting a Security Send command, that is subsequently\nfollowed by the host submitting a Security Receive command. The Security Send command specifies a\nCDP Request Data Frame (refer to Figure 630) that specifies:\n•\na Request Message Type value of 05h (i.e., Random Nonce Request); and\n•\nCDP Random Nonce Request Data (refer to Figure 638).\nOnce the controller returns a successful completion of the Security Send command, then the host should\ncheck the result of the read random nonce request by submitting a Security Receive command. The\ncontroller returns a successful completion of the Security Receive command and returns a CDP Nonce\nRead Data Frame (refer to Figure 639) indicating the random nonce generated by the controller.\nIf an error occurs during the processing of the Security Send command to retrieve the random nonce, then\nthe controller sets the Result Code field to 01h (i.e., General Failure).\nThe controller shall purge the random nonce to prevent random nonce reuse by the host.:\n•\nduring a Controller Level Reset; and\n•\nduring the processing of the Security Send command for a Personality Unfreeze Request operation\n(refer to section 8.1.6.2.2).",
