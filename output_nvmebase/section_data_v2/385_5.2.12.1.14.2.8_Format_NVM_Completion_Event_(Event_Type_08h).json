For a Format NVM command that formats all namespaces this field shall be cleared to 0h. |\n| | **Format NVM Status (FNVMS):** Contains the status of the format operation. |\n| | | **Bits** | **Description** |\n| | | 7:2 | Reserved |\n| | | 1 | **Incomplete Format (INCPFTF):** If this bit is set to '1', then the format operation modified some or all of the user data but did not complete successfully.

If this bit is cleared to '0', then the format operation either did not modify any user data or the format operation completed successfully. |\n| | | 0 | **Format NVM Error (FNVME):** If this bit is set to '1', then the format operation did not complete successfully. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the format operation completed successfully. |\n| 07:06 | **Completion Information (CINFO):** Contains a vendor specific value that may provide more information about the completion of the format operation (e.g., if the format operation did not complete successfully then this field may contain a vendor specific code that indicates a vendor specific reason). |\n| Bytes | Description |\n| 09:08 | **Status Info (INFO):** Identifies the status for the NVM Format command. |\n| | | **Bits** | **Description** |\n| | | 15:1 | **Status (STATUS):** This field indicates the value that was reported in the Status field for the completion queue entry (refer to Figure 100), if any, for the Format NVM command associated with this event.
