    "text": "The Track Memory Changes management operation of the Track Send command requests the controller\nprocessing that Track Send command to:\n•\nstart tracking host memory changes described by the specified host memory ranges that are\ncaused by the processing commands in the controller specified by Controller Identifier field (refer\nto Figure 496); or\n•\nstop tracking the host memory changes that are caused by the processing commands by the\ncontroller specified by Controller Identifier field.\nIf the TACT bit is set to ‘1’ (refer to Figure 495), then:\n•\nThe data buffer contains a Track Memory Changes data structure (refer to Figure 497) that\nspecifies one or more host memory ranges associated with the controller specified by the\nController Identifier field.\n•\nIf the value in the Requested Memory Range Tracking Granularity (RMRTG) field is greater than\nthe value in the Maximum Memory Range Tracking Granularity (MAXMRTG) field in the Identify\nController data structure (refer to Figure 328), then the controller shall abort the command with a\nstatus code of Invalid Field in Command.\n•\nIf the value in the Requested Memory Range Tracking Granularity (RMRTG) field is less than the\nvalue in the Minimum Memory Range Granularity (MINMRG) field in the Identify Controller data\nstructure (refer to Figure 328), then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of\nInvalid Field in Command.\n•\nIf the sum of:\nthe value in the Requested Number of Memory Range Tracking Descriptors (RNMRTD)\nfield; and\nthe number of Memory Range Tracking Descriptors currently being tracked by the\ncontroller processing the command for other controllers in the NVM subsystem,\nis greater than the value in the Controller Maximum Memory Range Tracking Descriptors\n(CMMRTD) field in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328), then the controller\nprocessing the command shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.\n•\nIf the sum of the value in the Requested Number of Memory Range Tracking Descriptors\n(RNMRTD) field plus the number of Memory Range Tracking Descriptors currently being tracked\nby all controllers in the NVM subsystem is greater than the value in the NVM subsystem Maximum\nMemory Range Tracking Descriptors (NMMRTD) field in the Identify Controller data structure (refer\nto Figure 328), then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in\nCommand.\n•\nIf any controller in the NVM subsystem is already tracking host memory changes for the controller\nspecified by the CNTLID field, then the controller processing the command shall abort the\ncommand with a status code of Invalid Controller Identifier.\n•\nthe Memory Range Tracking Length Limit (MRTLL) bit in the Identify Controller data\nstructure is set to ‘1’; and\nthe length as specified by the Requested Memory Range Tracking Granularity field and\nany Length field in a Track Memory Changes data structure is not a value that is a power\nof 2,\nthen the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.\nIf the TACT bit is cleared to ‘0’, then the data buffer shall be ignored by the controller.\nIf the controller specified by the CNTLID field is suspended (refer to section 5.2.17.1.1), then the controller\nshall abort the command with a status code of Controller Suspended.\nFigure 498 defines a Memory Range Tracking Descriptor. The address range specified by a Memory Range\nTracking Descriptor describes addresses specified in an SGL or PRP for a command submitted by a host\nto the controller specified in the CNTLID field (refer to Figure 496).\nIf the controller is unable to track the requested number of Memory Range Tracking Descriptors (i.e.,\nspecified in the RNMRTD field) or unable to track the memory changes at the specified granularity (i.e.,\nRMRTG field), then:\n•\nthe controller shall abort the command with a status code of Not Enough Resources; and\n•\nDword 0 and Dword 1 of the completion queue entry shall be returned as defined in Figure 499\nand Figure 500.\nIf any Address field is not aligned to the granularity specified by the RMRTG field, then the controller shall\nabort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.\nIf the address range specified by the Address field and the Length field specifies an address that is not host\nmemory (refer to section 1.5.47) associated with the controller specified by the CNTLID field, then the\ncontroller processing the command shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in\nCommand. If:\n•\nthe command is successful; and\n•\nthe configuration within the controller associated with the controller specified by the CNTLID field\nchanges resulting in that address range is no longer specifying host memory associated with the\ncontroller specified by the CNTLID field (e.g., the address range overlaps with PMR or CMB), then\nthe behavior for tracking host memory changes for the controller specified by the CNTLID field is\nundefined.\nA host should not specify MSI or MSI-X registers in the address range. If the address range specified by\nthe Address field and the Length field contains addresses for MSI or MSI-X registers on the controller\nspecified by the CNTLID field, then the controller may or may not report modification to those MSI or MSI-\nX register addresses.",
