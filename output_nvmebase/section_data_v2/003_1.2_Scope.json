These properties are to be implemented by an\ninstance of a controller using a specific NVMe Transport. This specification also defines common aspects\nof the NVMe I/O Command Sets that may be supported by a controller.\nThere are three types of controllers with different capabilities (refer to section 3.1.3):\na) I/O controllers;\nb) Discovery controllers; and\nc) Administrative controllers.\nIn this document the generic term controller is often used instead of enumerating specific controller types\nwhen applicable controller types may be determined from the context.",
