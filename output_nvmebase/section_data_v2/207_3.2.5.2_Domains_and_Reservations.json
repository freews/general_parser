    "text": "If an NVM subsystem supports multiple domains and Persistent Reservations (refer to section 8.1.24), then\nresumption after a division event (e.g., resumption of operation, resumption of communication) requires\nthat all persistent reservation state within the domains in the NVM subsystem that are no longer divided be\nsynchronized (i.e., updated).\nIf the reservation state for a namespace is not synchronized, then the ANA Group that contains that\nnamespace shall transition to the ANA Inaccessible state (refer to section 8.1.1.6) and remain in that state\nuntil the Persistent Reservation state is synchronized. If the Persistent Reservation state is not able to be\nsynchronized, then:\n•\na transition to the ANA Persistent Loss state occurs and commands are processed as described in\nsection 8.1.1.7; or\n•\nthe controller may stop processing commands and set the Controller Fatal Status (CSTS.CFS) bit\nto ‘1’ (refer to section 9.5).",
