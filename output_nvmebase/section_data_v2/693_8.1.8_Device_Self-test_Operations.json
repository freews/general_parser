    "text": "A device self-test operation is a diagnostic testing sequence that tests the integrity and functionality of the\ncontroller and may include testing of the media associated with namespaces or refresh operations. The\noperation is broken down into a series of segments, where each segment is a set of vendor specific tests\nor refresh operations. The segment number in the Self-test Result data structure (refer to section 5.2.12.1.7)\nis used for reporting purposes to indicate where a test failed, if any. The test performed in each segment\nmay be the same for the short device self-test operation and the extended device self-test operation.\nA device self-test operation is performed in the background allowing concurrent processing of some\ncommands and requiring suspension of the device self-test operation to process other commands. Which\ncommands may be processed concurrently versus require suspension of the device self-test operation is\nvendor specific.\nIf the controller receives any command that requires suspension of the device self-test operation to process\nand complete, then the controller shall:\nDuring a device self-test operation, the performance of the NVM subsystem may be degraded (e.g.,\ncontrollers not performing the device self-test operation may also experience degraded performance).\nThe following device self-test operations are defined:\na) short device self-test operation (refer to section 8.1.8.1);\nb) extended device self-test operation (refer to section 8.1.8.2); and\nc) Host-Initiated Refresh operation (refer to section 8.1.12).\nFigure 643 is an informative example of a device self-test operation with the associated segments and tests\nperformed in each segment.",
