    "text": "The Authenticated Data Read sequence is initiated by a Security Send command. The RPMB data frame\ndelivered from the host to the controller includes the Request Message Type = 0004h, Nonce, Address,\nand the Sector Count.\nWhen the controller receives this RPMB Data Frame, that controller first checks the Address. If there is an\nerror in the Address, then the result is set to 0004h (address failure) and the data read is not valid.\nWhen the host receives a successful completion of the Security Send command from the controller, that\nhost should send a Security Receive command to the controller to retrieve the data. The controller returns\nan RPMB Data Frame with Response Message Type (0400h), the Sector Count, a copy of the Nonce\nreceived in the request, the Address, the Data, the controller calculated MAC, and the Result. Note: It is\nthe responsibility of the host to verify the MAC returned on an Authenticated Data Read Request.\nIf the data transfer from the addressed location in the controller fails, the returned Result is 0006h (read\nfailure). If the Address provided in the Security Send command is not valid, then the returned Result is\n0004h (address failure). If another error occurs during the read procedure, then the returned Result is 0001h\n(general failure).",
