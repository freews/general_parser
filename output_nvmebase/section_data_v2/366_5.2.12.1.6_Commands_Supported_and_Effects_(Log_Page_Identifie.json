    "text": "This log page is used to describe the commands that the controller supports and the effects of those\ncommands on the state of the NVM subsystem. The log page is 4,096 bytes in size. There is one\nCommands Supported and Effects data structure per Admin command opcode value. For controllers that\nimplement I/O Queues, there is one Commands Supported and Effects data structure per I/O command\nopcode value for a specified I/O Command Set based on:\na) the I/O Command Set selected in CC.CSS, if CC.CSS is not set to 110b; and\nb) the Command Set Identifier field in CDW 14, if CC.CSS is set to 110b.\nThe Commands Supported and Effects data structure describes the overall possible effect of a command\nincluding any optional features of the command.\nThe host may take command effects into account when determining how to submit commands and actions\nto take after the command is complete. It is recommended that if a command may change a particular\ncapability that the host re-enumerate and/or re-initialize the associated capability after the command is\ncomplete. For example, if a namespace capability change may occur, then the host is recommended to\npause the use of the associated namespace, submit the command that may cause a namespace capability\nchange and wait for its completion, and then re-issue the Identify command.\nIf the namespace is attached to multiple controllers, the host(s) associated with those controllers should\ncoordinate their commands to meet the Command Submission and Execution requirements (refer to Figure\n214). The details of this coordination are outside the scope of this specification.",
