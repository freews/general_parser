A bit in this field is set to '1' if the corresponding mechanism to ensure persistence is supported. A bit in this field is cleared to '0' if the corresponding mechanism to ensure persistence is not supported.<br>At least one bit in this field shall be set to '1'. |\n| | | | <table><tr><th>Bits</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>3:2</td><td>Reserved</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Completion of PMRSTSR Read (CPMTSTSR): The completion of a read to the PMRSTS property shall ensure that all prior writes to the Persistent Memory Region have completed and are persistent.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Completion of Memory Read (CMR): The completion of a memory read from any Persistent Memory Region address ensures that all prior writes to the Persistent Memory Region have completed and are persistent.</td></tr></table> |\n| Bits | Type | Reset | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 9:8 | RO | Impl Spec | Persistent Memory Region Time Units (PMRTU): Indicates Persistent Memory Region time units. |\n| | | | <table><tr><th>Value</th><th>Persistent Memory Region Time Units</th></tr><tr><td>00b</td><td>500 milliseconds</td></tr><tr><td>01b</td><td>minutes</td></tr><tr><td>10b to 11b</td><td>Reserved</td></tr></table> |\n| 7:5 | RO | Impl Spec | Base Indicator Register (BIR): This field indicates the Base Address Register (BAR) that specifies the address and size of the Persistent Memory Region.
