    "text": "Reservations for a dispersed namespace that is able to be accessed by controllers in multiple participating\nNVM subsystems are intended to be coordinated between each participating NVM subsystem. To ensure\nthe uniqueness of a host’s identity and prevent potential data corruption, each host that sets the Host\nDispersed Namespace Support (HDISNS) field to 1h in the Host Behavior Support feature specifies a Host\nIdentifier that is unique across all hosts that connect to any participating NVM subsystem, as described in\nsection 8.1.10.3.\nIf a host is a reservation registrant on a dispersed namespace, and that host submits a Reservation Report\ncommand to that namespace, then for reservations established using controllers that are not contained in\nthe same participating NVM subsystem as the controller processing the Reservation Report command, the\nController ID (CNTLID) field shall be set to FFFDh in the Registered Controller data structure (refer to Figure\n617) or Registered Controller Extended data structure (refer to Figure 618). Multiple identical Registered\nController or Registered Controller Extended data structures with the CNTLID field set to FFFDh shall not\nbe returned by a single Reservation Report command; as a result, a Registered Controller or Registered\nController Extended data structure with the CNTLID field set to FFFDh indicates one or more controllers\nare associated with a host that is a registrant of the dispersed namespace in another participating NVM\nsubsystem. A Registered Controller or Registered Controller Extended data structure with the CNTLID field\nset to FFFDh is returned for each host (i.e., as identified by the HOSTID field in that data structure) that is\na registrant of the dispersed namespace in any other participating NVM subsystem.\nThe Dispersed Namespace Reservation Support (DISNSRS) bit in a command is set to ‘1’ by hosts that\nsupport reservations on dispersed namespaces (i.e., hosts that support receiving a value of FFFDh in the\nCNTLID field of a Registered Controller data structure or Registered Controller Extended data structure).\nA controller that supports dispersed namespaces and supports reservations (i.e., a controller that has the\nReservations Support (RESERVS) bit set to ‘1’ in the Optional NVM Command Support (ONCS) field of the\nIdentify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328)) shall support the DISNSRS bit being set to ‘1’ in each\ncommand in the following list:\n•\nReservation Acquire (refer to section 7.5);\n•\nReservation Register (refer to section 7.6);\n•\nReservation Release (refer to section 7.7); and\n•\nReservation Report (refer to section 7.8).\nIf the HDISNS field is set to 1h in the Host Behavior Support feature and the DISNSRS bit is cleared to ‘0’\nin any of the commands in the preceding list when submitted to a dispersed namespace, then the controller\nshall abort that command with a status code of Namespace Is Dispersed.",
