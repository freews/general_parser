    "text": "This Feature configures an NVM Set to use Predictable Latency Mode, including warning event thresholds.\nPredictable Latency Mode and events are disabled by default. The attributes are specified in Command\nDword 11, Command Dword 12, and the Deterministic Threshold Configuration data structure.\nThe NVM Set has transitioned to Predictable Latency Mode when the controller completes a Set Features\ncommand successfully with the Predictable Latency Enable bit in Command Dword 12 set to ‘1’. A transition\nto the Predictable Latency Mode may be delayed (i.e., the Set Features command completion is delayed)\nif the NVM subsystem needs to perform background operations on the NVM in order to operate in\nPredictable Latency Mode. Upon successful completion of this command, the controller shall be in the Non-\nDeterministic Window.\nIf a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure 422 are returned\nin Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command and the Deterministic Threshold Configuration\ndata structure is returned.\nPredictable Latency Events (refer to section 5.2.12.1.12) are configured as described in Figure 423.",
