    "text": "The Device Self-test command is used to start a device self-test operation or abort a device self-test\noperation (refer to section 8.1.8). The Device Self-test command is used specifically to:\na) start a short device self-test operation;\nb) start an extended device self-test operation;\nc) start a Host-Initiated Refresh operation;\nd) start a vendor specific device self-test operation; or\ne) abort a device self-test operation already in process.\nA Host-Initiated Refresh operation is a device self-test operation.\nThe device self-test operation is performed by the controller that the Device Self-test command was\nsubmitted to. The Namespace Identifier field controls which namespaces are included in the device self-\ntest operation as specified in Figure 174. For a Host-Initiated Refresh operation, the Namespace Identifier\nfield shall be ignored by the controller.\nThe Device Self-test command uses the Command Dword 10 field and the Command Dword 15 field. All\nother command specific fields are reserved.\nThe processing of a Device Self-test command and interactions with a device self-test operation already in\nprogress is defined in Figure 177.",
