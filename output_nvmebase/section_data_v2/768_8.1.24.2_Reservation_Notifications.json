Conditions that cause a reservation notification to occur are described in the\nfollowing sections. A Reservation Notification log page is created whenever an unmasked reservation\nnotification occurs on a namespace associated with the controller (refer to section 5.2.12.1.34). Reservation\nnotifications may be masked from generating a Reservation Notification log page on a per reservation\nnotification type and per namespace ID basis through the Reservation Notification Mask feature (refer to\nsection 5.2.26.1.33). A host may use the Asynchronous Event Request command (refer to section 5.2.2)\nto be notified of the presence of one or more available Reservation Notification log pages (refer to section\n5.2.12.1.34).",
