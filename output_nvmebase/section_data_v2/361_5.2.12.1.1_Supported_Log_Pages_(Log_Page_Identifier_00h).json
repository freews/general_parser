    "text": "An NVM subsystem may support several interfaces for submitting a Get Log Page command such as an\nAdmin Submission Queue, PCIe VDM Management Endpoint, or 2-Wire Management Endpoint (refer to\nthe NVM Express Management Interface Specification for details on Management Endpoints) and may\nhave zero or more instances of each of those interfaces. The log pages supported on each instance of each\ninterface may be different. This log page is used to describe the log pages that are supported on the\ninterface to which the Get Log Page command was submitted and attributes specific to each log page. The\nlog page is defined in Figure 207. The attributes of each log page are described in a LID Supported and\nEffects data structure defined in Figure 208.\nIf the UUID Selection Supported bit is set to ‘1’ for the Get Log Page command in the Commands Supported\nand Effects log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.6), then the log page data reflects the log pages that are\nsupported based on the value of the UUID Index field (refer to section 8.1.30).\nFor controllers that implement I/O Queues, the log pages that the controller supports are dependent on the\nI/O Command Set that is based on:\n•\nthe I/O Command Set selected in CC.CSS, if CC.CSS is not set to 110b; and\n•\nthe Command Set Identifier (CSI) field in CDW 14, if CC.CSS is set to 110b.",
