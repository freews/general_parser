    "text": "The Get Features command retrieves the attributes of the Feature specified.\nThe Get Features command uses the Data Pointer, Command Dword 10 and Command Dword 14 fields.\nThe use of the Command Dword 11 field is Feature specific. If not used by a Feature, then Command\nDword 11 is reserved unless otherwise stated. All other command specific fields are reserved.\nThe mandatory, optional, and prohibited Feature Identifiers for each type of controller are defined in section\n3.1.3.6.\nIf the controller supports selection of a UUID by the Get Features command (refer to Figure 403 and section\n8.1.30) and the controller supports selection of a UUID for:\n•\nthe specified vendor specific Feature Identifier (refer to Figure 403); or\n•\nvendor-specific attributes within a Feature (e.g., vendor-specific personalities in the Configurable\nDevice Personality feature as defined in section 5.2.26.1.24) defined by this specification or any\napplicable NVM Express I/O Command Set specification,\nthen Command Dword 14 is used to specify a UUID Index value (refer to Figure 197).\nIf the controller does not support selection of a UUID by the Get Features command or the controller does\nnot support selection of a UUID for:\n•\nthe specified vendor specific Feature Identifier; or\n•\nvendor-specific attributes within a Feature defined by this specification or any applicable NVM\nExpress I/O Command Set specification,\nthen Command Dword 14 does not specify a UUID Index value.\nFigure 198 describes the Feature Identifiers whose attributes may be retrieved using the Get Features\ncommand. The definition of the attributes returned and the associated format is specified in the section\nindicated.",
