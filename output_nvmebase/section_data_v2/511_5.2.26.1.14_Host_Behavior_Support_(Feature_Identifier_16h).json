    "text": "This Feature enables use of controller functionality that is associated with and depends upon specific host\nbehavior that may or may not be supported by all hosts. A controller does not use such functionality unless\nthe host has indicated that the host supports the specific host behavior upon which the functionality\ndepends. The host indicates that support to the controller by setting a field in this Feature. That host action\nenables controller use of the associated functionality with that host. A controller shall not use functionality\nwith a host that has not indicated support for the associated specific host behavior upon which that controller\nfunctionality depends. The attributes in Figure 426 are transferred in the data buffer.\nFor example, the Command Interrupted status code is associated with and depends upon the specific host\nbehavior that the host is expected to retry commands that are aborted with that status code. That command\nretry behavior may or may not be supported by all hosts (e.g., hosts compliant with versions 1.3 and earlier\nof the NVM Express Base Specification are unlikely to retry commands aborted with the Command\nInterrupted status code as that status code was introduced after NVM Express Base Specification, Revision\n1.3). A host that supports that command retry behavior indicates its support to the controller by setting a\nfield to 1h in the Host Behavior Support Feature. Setting that field to 1h enables controller use of the\nCommand Interrupted status code, with the result that this status code is used only with hosts that have\nindicated support for the associated command retry behavior.\nThis Feature is not saveable (refer to Figure 199). The default value of this Feature shall be all bytes cleared\nto 0h.\nAfter a successful completion of a Set Features command for this Feature, the controller may use controller-\nto-host functionality that depends on specific host behavior as indicated by the attributes. If multiple Set\nFeatures commands for this Feature are processed by the controller, only information from the most recent\nsuccessful command is retained (i.e., subsequent commands replace information provided by previous\ncommands).\nIf a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure 426 are returned\nin the data buffer for that command.",

        "table_md": "| Bytes | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 00 | **Advanced Command Retry Enable (ACRE):** If this bit is set to 1h, then the Command Interrupted status code is enabled (refer to Figure 102) and command retry delays are enabled. The controller may use the Command Interrupted status code and may indicate a command retry delay by setting the Command Retry Delay (CRD) field to a non-zero value in the Status field of a completion queue entry, refer to Figure 100. A host that sets this field to 1h indicates host support for the command retry behaviors that are specified for both the Command Interrupted status code and non-zero values in the CRD field.<br>If this bit is cleared to 0h, then both the Command Interrupted status code and command retry delays are disabled. The controller shall not use the Command Interrupted status code, and shall clear the CRD field in all CQEs.<br>All values other than 0h and 1h are reserved. |\n| 01 | **Extended Telemetry Data Area 4 Supported (ETDAS):** If this bit is set to 1h, then Telemetry Host Initiated Data Area 4 and Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 4 are supported by the host. If the Data Area 4 Support (DA4S) bit is set to '1' of the Log Page Attributes field, then the controller may populate Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 4 (refer to section 5.2.12.1.9) and the Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 4 (refer to section 5.2.12.1.9).<br>If this field is cleared to 0h, then Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 4 and Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 4 are not supported by the host.<br>All values other than 0h and 1h are reserved. |\n| 02 | **LBA Format Extension Enable (LBAFEE):** I/O Command Set specific definition. Refer to the applicable NVM Express NVM Command Set specification for details.<br>All values other than 0h and 1h are reserved. |\n| 03 | **Host Dispersed Namespace Support (HDISNS):** If this bit is set to 1h, then dispersed namespaces are enabled. A host that sets this field to 1h specifies that globally unique namespace identifiers (refer to section 8.1.10.2) are used for identifying namespaces (e.g., multi-path I/O software does not use the NSID of the namespace as the sole method for detection of multiple paths to that namespace).<br>A host that supports reservations (refer to section 8.1.24) and sets this field to 1h specifies a Host Identifier that is unique across all hosts that connect to any participating NVM subsystem.<br>If this bit is cleared to 0h, then dispersed namespaces are disabled. If the participating NVM subsystem prohibits host access to dispersed namespaces (refer to section 8.1.10.4) and this field is cleared to 0h, then the controller aborts any I/O commands (refer to section 7 in this specification and the I/O Commands section in the applicable NVM Express I/O Command Set specification) or any of the Admin commands listed in Figure 663 that the host submits to dispersed namespaces with a status code of Host Dispersed Namespace Support Not Enabled, as described in section 8.1.10.4.<br>All values other than 0h and 1h are reserved. |\n| | |\n| Bytes | Description |\n| | **Copy Descriptor Formats Enable (CDFE):** The bits in this field that are used (i.e., are neither reserved nor unused) enable the corresponding Copy Descriptor Formats (e.g., the Copy Descriptor Format 2h Enable (CDF2E) bit enables Copy Descriptor Format 2h). Bits in this field that this specification defines as unused (i.e., bits 1:0) correspond to Copy Descriptor Formats (refer to the NVM Express NVM Command Set Specification) that are always enabled if they are supported. |\n| 05:04 | | |\n| | Bits | Description |\n| | 15:5 | Reserved |\n| | 4 | **Copy Descriptor Format 4h Enable (CDF4E):** If this bit is set to '1' and the controller supports Copy Descriptor Format 4h, then Copy Descriptor Format 4h is enabled. If this bit is cleared to '0', or the controller does not support Copy Descriptor Format 4h, then Copy Descriptor Format 4h is disabled. |\n| | 3 | **Copy Descriptor Format 3h Enable (CDF3E):** If this bit is set to '1' and the controller supports Copy Descriptor Format 3h, then Copy Descriptor Format 3h is enabled. If this bit is cleared to '0', or the controller does not support Copy Descriptor Format 3h, then Copy Descriptor Format 3h is disabled. |\n| | 2 | **Copy Descriptor Format 2h Enable (CDF2E):** If this bit is set to '1' and the controller supports Copy Descriptor Format 2h, then Copy Descriptor Format 2h is enabled. If this bit is cleared to '0', or the controller does not support Copy Descriptor Format 2h, then Copy Descriptor Format 2h is disabled. |\n| | 1:0 | **Not Used (NUSED):** The controller shall ignore these bits when processing a Set Features command that specifies this Feature and shall clear these bits to '0' in the attributes returned in the data buffer for a Get Features command that specifies this Feature. |\n| 511:06 | Reserved |"
