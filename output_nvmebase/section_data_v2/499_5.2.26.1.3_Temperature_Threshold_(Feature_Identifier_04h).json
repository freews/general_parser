    "text": "This Feature allows the host to configure temperature thresholds. The attributes are specified in Command\nDword 11 (refer to Figure 407).\nA controller may report up to nine temperature values in the SMART / Health Information log page (i.e., the\nComposite Temperature and Temperature Sensor 1 through Temperature Sensor 8; refer to Figure 210).\nAssociated with each implemented temperature sensor is an over temperature threshold and an under\ntemperature threshold. When a temperature is greater than or equal to its corresponding over temperature\nthreshold or less than or equal to its corresponding under temperature threshold, then the Temperature\nThreshold Condition (TTC) bit is set to ‘1’ of the Critical Warning field in the SMART / Health Information\nlog page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.3). This may trigger an asynchronous event.\nThe over temperature threshold feature shall be implemented for Composite Temperature. The under\ntemperature threshold Feature shall be implemented for Composite Temperature if a non-zero Warning\nComposite Temperature Threshold (WCTEMP) field value is reported in the Identify Controller data\nstructure (refer to Figure 328). The over temperature threshold and under temperature threshold features\nshall be implemented for all implemented temperature sensors (i.e., all Temperature Sensor fields that\nreport a non-zero value).\nThe default value of the over temperature threshold feature for Composite Temperature is the value in the\nWCTEMP field in the Identify Controller data structure if the value of the WCTEMP field is non-zero;\notherwise, the default value is implementation specific. The default value of the under temperature threshold\nfeature for Composite Temperature is implementation specific. The default value of the over temperature\nthreshold for all implemented temperature sensors is FFFFh. The default value of the under temperature\nthreshold for all implemented temperature sensors is 0h.\nIf a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the temperature threshold selected by Command\nDword 11 is returned in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.",
