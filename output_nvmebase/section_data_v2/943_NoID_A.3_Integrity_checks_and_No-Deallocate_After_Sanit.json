    "text": "Another issue is availability of the data returned through the interface. Some of the sanitize operations (e.g.,\nBlock Erase) affect the physical devices in such a way that directly reading the accessible storage may\ntrigger internal integrity checks resulting in error responses instead of returning the contents of the storage.\nOther sanitize operations (e.g., Crypto Erase) may scramble the vendor specific internal format of the data,\nalso resulting in error responses instead of returning the contents of the storage.\nTo compensate for these issues, a controller may perform additional internal write operations to media that\nis able to be allocated for user data (i.e., additional media modification, refer to section 8.1.26.2) so that all\nmedia in the sanitization target that is allocated for user data is readable without error. However, this has\nthe side effect of potentially significant additional wear on the media as well as the side effect of obscuring\nthe results of the initial sanitize operation (i.e., the writes destroy the ability to forensically audit the result\nof the initial sanitize operation). Given this side effect, process audits of sanitize behavior only provide\neffective results when the No-Deallocate After Sanitize bit is set the same way (e.g., set to ‘1’) for both\nprocess audits and the individual forensic device audits.\nThe Sanitize command introduced in NVM Express Base Specification, Revision 1.3 included a mechanism\nto specify that sanitized media in the NVM subsystem that is allocated for user data not be deallocated,\nthereby allowing observations of the results of the sanitization operation. However, some architectures and\nproducts (e.g., integrity checking circuitry) interact with this capability in such a way as to defeat the sanitize\nresult observability purpose. New features were added to NVM Express Base Specification, Revision 1.4\nthat include extended information about the sanitization capabilities of devices, a new asynchronous event,\nand configuration of the response to No-Deallocate After Sanitize requests. These features are intended to\nboth support new systems that understand the new capabilities, as well as to help manage legacy systems\nthat do not understand the new capabilities without losing the ability to sanitize as requested.\nThese issues in returning the contents of accessible storage do not apply if the sanitization target is in the\nMedia Verification state (refer to section 8.1.26.4.6). In that state, failure of internal integrity checks do not\ncause error responses to Read commands (refer to the Media Verification section of the NVM Express\nNVM Command Set Specification). Because the command that caused entry to the Media Verification state\nspecified the Enter Media Verification State (EMVS) bit set to ‘1’, the controller does not perform the\nadditional media modification described in this section.",
