    "text": "The FDP Configurations log page (refer to Figure 286) identifies a list of static FDP configurations that are\nallowed to be applied to the specified Endurance Group. The Endurance Group Identifier in the Log Specific\nIdentifier field as defined in Figure 221 specifies the Endurance Group. The creation of an Endurance Group\nor the enablement of an FDP configuration in an Endurance Group within the NVM subsystem may affect\nwhich FDP configurations are currently allowed (refer to the FDP Configuration Valid bit in Figure 287).\nRefer to section 8.1.11 for the usage of this log page by the host.\nFigure 287 defines the format of an FDP Configuration Descriptor. The Reclaim Unit Handles in the Reclaim\nUnit Handle list shall be listed in ascending order of Reclaim Unit Handle Identifier.\nThe format of the Placement Identifier used in the Data Placement Directive (refer to section 8.1.9.4) for a\nspecific FDP configuration is dependent on the number of Reclaim Groups supported by the FDP\nconfiguration in use and the number of bits allocated for the Reclaim Group Identifier field. If the NRG field\n(refer to Figure 287) is set to 1h indicating that there is only one Reclaim Group and zero bits are allocated\nto the Reclaim Group Identifier (i.e., the RGIF field (refer to Figure 287) is cleared to 0h), then the format\nof the Placement Identifier is defined in Figure 289. If one or more bits are allocated to the Reclaim Group\nIdentifier (i.e., the RGIF field is non-zero), then the format of the Placement Identifier is defined in Figure\n290.",

This bit is cleared to '0' to indicate that this entry is not currently available and the host should ignore this FDP configuration. |\n| | | 6:5 | **Reserved** |\n| | | 4 | **FDP Volatile Write Cache (FDPVWC):** If this bit is set to '1', then a volatile write cache is present in this FDP configuration. If this bit is cleared to '0', then a volatile write cache is not present for this FDP configuration. If the controller reports one or more FDP configurations with this bit set to '1', then the Volatile Write Cache Present (VWCP) bit in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328) shall be set to '1'. This results in the VWCP bit being set to '1' even though there is no volatile write cache in the controller to support hosts not aware of the Flexible Data Placement capability (refer to section 8.1.11). Refer to section 7.2 to determine if a volatile write cache is present if a namespace exists in an Endurance Group that has Flexible Data Placement enabled. |\n| | | | |\n| | | 3:0 | **Reclaim Group Identifier Format (RGIF):** This field identifies the number of most-significant bits in the Placement Identifier that contain the Reclaim Group Identifier (refer to Figure 289 and Figure 290).
