    "text": "A host that is a registrant of a namespace may unregister with the namespace by executing a Reservation\nRegister command (refer to section 7.6) on the namespace with the RREGA field set to 001b (i.e.,\nUnregister Reservation Key) and supplying its current reservation key in the CRKEY field. If the contents\nof the CRKEY field do not match the key currently associated with the host, then the command is aborted\nwith a status code of Reservation Conflict. If the host is not a registrant, then the command is aborted with\na status code of Reservation Conflict.\nSuccessful completion of an unregister operation causes the host to no longer be a registrant of that\nnamespace. A host may unregister without regard to its current reservation key value by setting the IEKEY\nbit to '1' in the Reservation Register command.\nUnregistering by a host may cause a reservation held by the host to be released. If a host is the last\nremaining reservation holder (i.e., the reservation type is Write Exclusive - All Registrants or Exclusive\nAccess - All Registrants) or is the only reservation holder, then the reservation is released when the host\nunregisters.\nIf a reservation is released and the type of the released reservation was Write Exclusive - Registrants Only\nor Exclusive Access - Registrants Only, then a reservation released notification occurs on all controllers\nassociated with a registered host other than the host that issued the Reservation Register command.",
