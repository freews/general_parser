    "text": "This section describes capsules and data transfer mechanisms necessary to support message-based\ntransport queues. These mechanisms are used for Fabrics commands, Admin commands, and I/O\ncommands when using the message-based transport queue model.\nA capsule is an NVMe unit of information exchanged between a host and a controller. A capsule may\ncontain commands, responses, SGLs, and/or data. The data may include user data (e.g., logical block data\nand metadata that is transferred as a contiguous part of the logical block) and data structures associated\nwith the command.\nThe capsule size for the Admin Queue commands and responses is fixed and defined in the NVMe\nTransport binding specification. The controller indicates in the Identify Controller data structure the capsule\ncommand and response sizes that the host shall use with I/O commands.\nThe controller shall support SGL based data transfers for commands on both the Admin Queue and I/O\nQueues. Data may be transferred within the capsule or through memory transactions based on the\nunderlying NVMe Transport as indicated in the SGL descriptors associated with the command capsule. The\nSGL types supported by an NVMe Transport are specified in the NVMe Transport binding specification.\nThe value of unused and not reserved capsule fields (e.g., the capsule is larger than the command /\nresponse and associated data) is undefined and shall not be interpreted by the recipient.",
