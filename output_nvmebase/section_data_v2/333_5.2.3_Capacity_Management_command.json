    "text": "A host uses the Capacity Management command to configure Endurance Groups and NVM Sets in an\nNVM subsystem by either selecting one of a set of supported configurations (i.e., Fixed Capacity\nManagement; refer to section 8.1.4.2) or by specifying the capacity of the Endurance Group or NVM Set to\nbe created (i.e., Variable Capacity Management; refer to section 8.1.4.3). The Capacity Management\ncommand specifies the operations defined in Figure 160.\nThe Capacity Management command uses the Command Dword 10, Command Dword 11, and Command\nDword 12 fields. All other command specific fields are reserved.\nFor requirements to support the operations in Figure 160, refer to section 8.1.4.\nIf the Operation field specifies the Create Endurance Group operation or the Create NVM Set operation,\nthen the Capacity Upper and Capacity Lower fields specify the capacity of the Endurance Group or NVM\nSet to be created. If the Operation field specifies any other operation, then the Capacity Upper field and the\nCapacity Lower field are reserved.",
