    "text": "The Remove Active ZoneGroup (RAZ) operation allows a DDC to remove from the CDC an active\nZoneGroup associated with the DDC initiating the RAZ operation. For a push model DDC, the RAZ\noperation is mapped to an FZL command to provide to the CDC with the identifier of the ZoneGroup to\nremove, as shown in Figure 761.\nThe identifier of the ZoneGroup to remove is provided in the FZL buffer, as shown in Figure 762.\nFor the FZS command of an RAZ request operation:\n•\nif the requested ZoneGroup does not exist on the CDC, then the CDC shall abort the command\nwith a status code of Zoning Data Structure Not Found; or\n•\nif the requested ZoneGroup is locked on the CDC (i.e., another administrative interface is modifying\nthat ZoneGroup), then the CDC shall abort the command with a status code of Zoning Data\nStructure Locked.\nThe CDC may enforce access restrictions to the Zoning data structures. In this case, the CDC shall check\nif the DDC issuing the FZL command is authorized to remove the ZoneGroup specified in the FZL data\n(e.g., if the CDC allows access to a ZoneGroup only to the DDC that created that ZoneGroup, verify that\nthe ZoneGroup Originator field matches the NQN contained in the HOSTNQN field of the Connect\ncommand sent from the DDC to that CDC). If that DDC is not authorized to access the specified ZoneGroup,\nthen the CDC shall abort the FZL command with a status code of ZoneGroup Originator Invalid.",
