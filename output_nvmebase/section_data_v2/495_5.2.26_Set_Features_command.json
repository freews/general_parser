This column is only valid if the feature is not saveable (refer to section 4.4). If the feature is saveable, then this column is not used. | | | | |\n| 3. The controller does not save settings for the Host Memory Buffer feature across power cycles and reset events (refer to section 8.2.3). However, the host may preserve and restore the previous contents of the Host Memory Buffer and the previous settings of the Host Memory Buffer feature as described by the MR bit in Figure 461. | | | | |\n| 4. The feature does not use a data buffer for Set Features commands and does use a data buffer for Get Features commands. Refer to section 5.2.26.2.4. | | | | |\n| 5. Selection of a UUID may be supported. Refer to section 8.1.30. | | | | |\n| 6. Refer to Feature Identifiers Supported and Effects log page in section 5.2.12.1.18 for how scope is reported to the host. | | | | |\n| 7. For an NVM subsystem with multiple controllers in the same domain, specifying different power states (refer to section 8.1.18) or different power limits (refer to section 8.1.18.6) for different controllers results in an unspecified power state or an unspecified power limit, respectively, for that domain. | | | | |"
