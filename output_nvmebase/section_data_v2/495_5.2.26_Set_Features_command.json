    "text": "The Set Features command specifies the attributes of the Feature indicated.\nThe Set Features command uses the Data Pointer, Command Dword 10, and Command Dword 14. The\nuse of Command Dword 11, Command Dword 12, Command Dword 13, and Command Dword 15 fields is\nFeature specific. If Command Dword 11, Command Dword 12, Command Dword 13, or Command Dword\n15 fields are not used, then the Command Dwords are reserved.\nIf the controller supports selection of a UUID by the Set Features command (refer to Figure 403 and section\n8.1.30) and the controller supports selection of a UUID for:\n•\nthe specified vendor specific feature identifier (refer to Figure 403); or\n•\nvendor-specific attributes within a Feature (e.g., vendor-specific personalities in the Configurable\nDevice Personality feature as defined in section 5.2.26.1.24) defined by this specification or any\napplicable NVM Express I/O Command Set specification,\nthen Command Dword 14 is used to specify a UUID Index value (refer to Figure 402).\nIf the controller does not support selection of a UUID by the Set Features command or the controller does\nnot support selection of a UUID for:\n•\nthe specified vendor specific feature identifier; or\n•\nvendor-specific attributes within a Feature defined by this specification or any applicable NVM\nExpress I/O Command Set specification,\nthen Command Dword 14 does not specify a UUID Index value.\nFigure 403 defines the Features that are able to be configured with a Set Features command and retrieved\nwith a Get Features command.\nSection 5.2.26.1 describes features that are common to all transport models. Section 5.2.26.2 describes\nfeatures that are specific to the Memory-based transport model. Section 5.2.26.3 describes features that\nare specific to the Message-based transport model.",
