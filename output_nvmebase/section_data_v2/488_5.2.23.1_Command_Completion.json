If a namespace sanitize\noperation starts (refer to section 8.1.26.4), then the Sanitize Status log page for the sanitization target shall\nbe updated before posting the completion queue entry for the command that started that namespace\nsanitize operation.\nSanitize Namespace command specific status values (i.e., SCT field set to 1h) are shown in Figure 392.",
