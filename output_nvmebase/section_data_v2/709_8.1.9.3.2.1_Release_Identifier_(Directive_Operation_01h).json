    "text": "The Release Identifier operation specifies that the stream identifier specified in the DSPEC field in\ncommand Dword 11 is no longer in use by the host. Specifically, if the host uses that stream identifier in a\nfuture operation, then that stream identifier is referring to a different stream. If the specified identifier does\nnot correspond to an open stream for the specified namespace, then the Directive Send command should\nnot fail as a result of the specified identifier. If there are stream resources allocated for the exclusive use of\nthe specified namespace, then those exclusive stream resources remain allocated for this namespace and\nmay be re-used in a subsequent write command. If there are no stream resources allocated for the exclusive\nuse of the specified namespace, then the stream resources are returned to the NVM subsystem stream\nresources for future use by a namespace without exclusive allocated stream resources. If an NSID value\nof FFFFFFFFh is specified, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field\nin Command.\nNo data transfer occurs.",
