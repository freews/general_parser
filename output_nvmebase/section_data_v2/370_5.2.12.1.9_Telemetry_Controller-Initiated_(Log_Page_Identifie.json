    "text": "This log page consists of a header (i.e., bytes 511:0 of the log page) describing the log and zero or more\nTelemetry Data Blocks (refer to section 8.1.29). The header shall always be available even if there is no\nTelemetry Controller-Initiated Data available. All Telemetry Data Blocks are 512 bytes in size. This log is a\ncontroller-initiated capture of internal controller-scoped or NVM subsystem-scoped state. The scope of the\nsaved state is determined by the value in the Telemetry Controller-Initiated Scope field. The Telemetry\nController-Initiated Data for Data Area 1 through Data Area 3 shall persist across all resets. The Telemetry\nController-Initiated Data for Data Area 4 may persist across Controller Level Resets. If the host specifies a\nLog Page Offset Lower value that is not a multiple of 512 bytes in the Get Log Page command for this log,\nthen the controller shall return an error of Invalid Field in Command.\nThe Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data consists of:\na) three areas, if the Data Area 4 Support (DA4S) bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the Log Page Attributes field:\nTelemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 1, Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 2, and\nTelemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 3; or\nb) four areas, if the DA4S bit is set to ‘1’ in the Log Page Attributes field: Telemetry Controller-Initiated\nData Area 1, Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 2, Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 3\nand Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 4.\nAll areas start at Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area Block 1. The last block of each area is indicated\nin the Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area y Last Block, respectively. The telemetry data captured and\nits size is implementation dependent.\nThe size of the log page is variable and:\n•\nIf the DA4S bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the Log Page Attributes field, the size may be calculated using\nthe Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 3 Last Block field.\n•\nIf the DA4S bit is set to ‘1’ in the Log Page Attributes field and the Extended Telemetry Data Area\n4 Supported (ETDAS) field is set to 1h in the Host Behavior Support feature (refer to section\n5.2.26.1.14), then the size of the log page may be calculated using the Telemetry Controller-\nInitiated Data Area 4 Last Block field.\n•\nIf the DA4S bit is set to ‘1’ in the Log Page Attributes field and the Extended Telemetry Data Area\n4 Supported (ETDAS) field is cleared to 0h in the Host Behavior Support feature (refer to section\n5.2.26.1.14), then the size of the log page may be calculated using the Telemetry Controller-\nInitiated Data Area 3 Last Block field.\nThe controller shall return data for all blocks requested:\n•\nIf the DA4S bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the Log Page Attributes field, then the data beyond the last block\nin Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 3 Last Block is undefined.\n•\nIf the DA4S bit is set to ‘1’ in the Log Page Attributes field, then the data beyond the last block in\nTelemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 4 Last Block is undefined.\n•\nIf the DA4S bit is set to ‘1’ in the Log Page Attributes field and the Extended Telemetry Data Area\n4 Supported (ETDAS) field is cleared to 0h in the Host Behavior Support feature, then the data\nbeyond the last block in Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 3 Last Block is undefined.\nIf the host requests a data transfer that is not a multiple of 512 bytes, then the controller shall abort the\ncommand with the status code of Invalid Field in Command.",

If this field is set to 1h, then this field shall not be cleared to 0h until a Get Log Page command with Retain Asynchronous Event bit cleared to '0' for the Telemetry Controller-Initiated log page completes successfully. This value is persistent across power states and reset. <br> Regardless of the value of this field, the log page may contain saved internal state available to be reported in response to a Get Log Page command issued out-of-band to a Management Endpoint (refer to the NVM Express Management Interface Specification). <br> Other values are reserved. |\n| 383 | **Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Generation Number (TCDGN):** Contains a value that is incremented each time internal state for this log page is captured.

This field is persistent across power cycles. |\n| 511:384 | **Reason Identifier (RID):** Contains a vendor specific identifier that describes the operating conditions of the controller at the time of capture. The Controller-Initiated Reason Identifier field should provide an identification of unique operating conditions of the controller. |\n| | **Data Block List** |\n| | 1023:512 | **Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Block 1:** Contains Telemetry Data Block 1 for the Telemetry Controller-Initiated log page captured at a vendor specific time. |\n| | 1535:1024 | **Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Block 2:** Contains Telemetry Data Block 2 for the Telemetry Controller-Initiated log page captured at a vendor specific time. |\n| | ... | ... |\n| | (n*512)+511:(n*512) | **Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Block n:** Contains Telemetry Data Block n for the Telemetry Controller-Initiated log page captured at a vendor specific time. |"
