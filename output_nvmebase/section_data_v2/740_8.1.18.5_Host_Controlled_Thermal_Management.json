    "text": "A controller may support host controlled thermal management (HCTM), as indicated in the Host Controlled\nThermal Management Attributes of the Identify Controller data structure in Figure 328. Host controlled\nthermal management provides a mechanism for the host to configure a controller to automatically transition\nbetween active power states or perform vendor specific thermal management actions in order to attempt to\nmeet thermal management requirements specified by the host. If active power states transitions are used\nto attempt to meet these thermal management requirements specified by the host, then those active power\nstates transitions are vendor specific.\nThe host specifies and enables the thermal management requirements by setting the Thermal Management\nTemperature 1 field and/or Thermal Management Temperature 2 field (refer to section 5.2.26.1.9) in a Set\nFeatures command to a non-zero value. The supported range of values for the Thermal Management\nTemperature 1 field and Thermal Management Temperature 2 field are indicated in the Identify Controller\ndata structure in Figure 328.\nThe Thermal Management Temperature 1 specifies that if the Composite Temperature (refer to Figure 211)\nis:\na) greater than or equal to this value; and\nb) less than the Thermal Management Temperature 2, if non-zero,\nthen the controller should start transitioning to lower power active power states or perform vendor specific\nthermal management actions while minimizing the impact on performance in order to attempt to reduce the\nComposite Temperature (e.g., transition to an active power state that performs light throttling).\nThe Thermal Management Temperature 2 field specifies that if the Composite Temperature is greater than\nor equal to this value, then the controller shall start transitioning to lower power active power states or\nperform vendor specific thermal management actions regardless of the impact on performance in order to\nattempt to reduce the Composite Temperature (e.g., transition to an active power state that performs heavy\nthrottling).\nIf the controller is currently in a lower power active power state or performing vendor specific thermal\nmanagement actions because of this feature (e.g., throttling performance) because the Composite\nTemperature is:\na) greater than or equal to the current value of the Thermal Management Temperature 1 field; and\nb) less than the current value of the Thermal Management Temperature 2 field,\nand the Composite Temperature decreases to a value below the current value of the Thermal Management\nTemperature 1 field, then the controller should return to the active power state that the controller was in\nprior to going to a lower power active power state or stop performing vendor specific thermal management\nactions because of this feature, the Composite Temperature and the current value of the Thermal\nManagement Temperature 1 field.\nIf the controller is currently in a lower power active power state or performing vendor specific thermal\nmanagement actions because the Composite Temperature is greater than or equal to the current value of\nthe Thermal Management Temperature 2 field and the Composite Temperature decreases to a value less\nthan the current value of the Thermal Management Temperature 1 field, then the controller should return\nto the active power state that the controller was in prior to going to a lower power active power state or stop\nperforming vendor specific thermal management actions because of this feature, and the Composite\nTemperature.\nThe temperature at which the controller stops being in a lower power active power state or performing\nvendor specific thermal management actions because of this feature is vendor specific (i.e., hysteresis is\nvendor specific).\nFigure 675 shows examples of how the Composite Temperature may be affected by this feature.\nNote: Since the host controlled thermal management (HCTM) feature uses the Composite Temperature,\nthe actual interactions between a platform (e.g., tablet, or laptop) and two different device implementations\nmay vary even with the same Thermal Management Temperature 1 and Thermal Management\nTemperature 2 temperature settings. The use of this feature requires validation between those devices’\nimplementations and the platform in order to be used effectively.\nThe SMART / Health Information log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.3) contains statistics related to Host\nController Thermal Management.",
