    "text": "The Host Memory Buffer (HMB) feature allows the controller to utilize an assigned portion of host memory\nexclusively. The use of the host memory resources is vendor specific. The host may not be able to provide\nany or a limited amount of the host memory resources requested by the controller. The controller shall\nfunction properly without host memory resources. Refer to section 5.2.26.2.4.\nThe controller may indicate limitations for the minimum usable descriptor entry size and the maximum\nnumber of descriptor entries (refer to the HMMINDS and HMMAXD fields in the Identify Controller data\nstructure, Figure 328). If the host does not create the Host Memory Buffer within the indicated limits, then\nthe host memory allocated for use by the controller may not be fully utilized (e.g., descriptor entries beyond\nthe maximum number of entries indicated may be ignored by the controller).\nDuring initialization, the host may provide a descriptor list that describes a set of host memory address\nranges for exclusive use by the controller. The host memory resources assigned are for the exclusive use\nof the controller (the host should not modify the ranges) until the host requests that the controller release\nthe ranges and the controller completes the Set Features command. The controller is responsible for\ninitializing the host memory resources. The host should request that the controller release the assigned\nranges prior to a shutdown event, a Runtime D3 event, or any other event that requires the host to reclaim\nthe assigned ranges. After the controller acknowledges that the ranges are no longer in use, the host may\nreclaim the host memory resources. In the case of Runtime D3, the host should provide the host memory\nresources to the controller again and inform the controller that the ranges were in use prior to the RTD3\nevent and have not been modified.\nThe host memory resources are not persistent in the controller across a Controller Level Reset. The host\nshould provide the previously allocated host memory resources to the controller after that reset completes.\nIf the host is providing previously allocated host memory resources (with the same contents) to the\ncontroller, the Memory Return bit (refer to Figure 476) is set to ‘1’ in the Set Features command.\nThe controller shall ensure that there is no data loss or data corruption in the event of a surprise removal\nwhile the Host Memory Buffer feature is being utilized.",
