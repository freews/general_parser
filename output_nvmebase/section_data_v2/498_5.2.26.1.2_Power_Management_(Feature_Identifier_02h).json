The attributes are specified in\nCommand Dword 11 (refer to Figure 405).\nUpon successful completion of a Set Features command for this Feature, the controller shall be in the\nPower State specified. For a transition to a non-operational power state, the device may exceed the power\nindicated for that non-operational power state as defined in section 8.1.18.1 (e.g., while completing this\ncommand). If enabled, autonomous power state transitions continue to occur from the new state.\nIf a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes described in Figure 406 are returned\nin Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.",
