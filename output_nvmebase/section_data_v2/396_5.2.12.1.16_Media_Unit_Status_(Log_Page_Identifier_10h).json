    "text": "This log page is used to describe the configuration and wear of Media Units (refer to section 8.1.4). The log\npage contains one Media Unit Status Descriptor for each Media Unit accessible by the specified domain.\nEach Media Unit Status Descriptor (refer to Figure 260) indicates the configuration of the Media Unit (e.g.,\nto which Endurance Group the Media Unit is assigned, to which NVM Set the Media Unit is assigned, to\nwhich Channels the Media Unit is attached) and indications of wear (e.g., the Available Spare field and the\nPercentage Used field). The indications of wear change as the Media Unit is written and read.\nIf the NVM subsystem supports multiple domains, then the controller reports the Media Unit Status log page\nfor the domain specified in the Log Specific Identifier field (refer to Figure 258), if accessible. If the\ninformation is not accessible, then the log page is not available (refer to section 8.1.1.10). If the Log Specific\nIdentifier field is cleared to 0h, then the specified domain is the domain containing the controller that is\nprocessing the command.\nMedia Unit Identifier values (refer to Figure 260) begin with 0h and increase sequentially. If the NVM\nsubsystem supports multiple domains, then the Media Unit Identifier values are unique within the specified\ndomain. If the NVM subsystem does not support multiple domains, then the Media Unit Identifier values are\nunique within the NVM subsystem.\nMedia Unit Status Descriptors are listed in ascending order by Media Unit Identifier.\nRequirements for supporting the Media Unit Status log page are defined in section 8.1.4.\nThe Media Unit Status Descriptor is defined in Figure 260.\nIf the Selected Configuration field is cleared to 0h, then the following fields in each Media Unit Status\nDescriptor shall be cleared to 0h:\na) Endurance Group Identifier (ENDGID);\nb) NVM Set Identifier (NVMSETID);\nc) Capacity Adjustment Factor; and\nd) Number of Channels (MUCS).\nChannel Identifier values begin with 0h and increase sequentially. If the NVM subsystem supports multiple\ndomains, then Channel Identifier values are unique within the specified domain. If the NVM subsystem does\nnot support multiple domains, then Channel Identifier values are unique within the NVM subsystem.\nIn the Media Unit Status Descriptor, Channel Identifiers are listed in ascending order by value, and each\nChannel Identifier shall appear only once.",

Refer to section 3.2.3. The value shall be less than or equal to the value of the Endurance Group Identifier Maximum field (refer to Figure 328). A value of 0h indicates that this Media Unit is not part of an Endurance Group. |\n| 07:06 | **NVM Set Identifier (NVMSETID):** This field indicates the identifier of the NVM Set that contains this Media Unit.

The relationship between this value and the value in the Available Spare field in the Endurance Group Information log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.10) is outside the scope of this specification. |\n| 11 | **Percentage Used (PUSED):** Contains a vendor specific estimate of the percentage of life used for the Media Unit based on the actual usage and the manufacturer's prediction of NVM life. A value of 100 indicates that the estimated endurance of the NVM in the Media Unit has been consumed, but may not indicate an NVM failure. The value is allowed to exceed 100. Percentages greater than 254 shall be represented as 255. This value shall be updated once per power-on hour when the controller is not in a sleep state. <br> Refer to the JEDEC JESD218B-02 standard for SSD device life and endurance measurement techniques. <br> The relationship between this value and the value in the Percentage Used field in the Endurance Group Information log page is outside the scope of this specification. |\n| 12 | **Number of Channels (MUCS):** This field indicates the number of Channels attached to this Media Unit. If this field is cleared to 0h, then no Channel Identifiers are reported for this Media Unit. |\n| 13 | **Channel Identifiers Offset (CIO):** This field indicates the offset of the Channel 0 identifier field from the beginning of the Media Unit Status Descriptor.
