This Feature shall be implemented if the CAP.CSS.IOCSS\nbit is set to ‘1’. When CC.CSS is set to any value other than 110b, then this Feature has no effect and the\nI/O Command Sets that may be used by the controller are specified by CC.CSS. If CC.CSS is set to any\nvalue other than 110b and the controller receives a Set Features command for this Feature, then this\ncommand has no effect and returns a status code of Successful Completion.\nWhen all supported I/O Command Sets (110b) is selected in CC.CSS, the value of this Feature specifies\nthe index of the I/O Command Set Combination in the Identify I/O Command Set data structure that is used.\nRefer to section 5.2.13.2.19 for more information. The Index is specified in the I/O Command Set\nCombination Index field of Command Dword 11 (refer to Figure 429). If any namespace attached to the\ncontroller uses an I/O Command Set that is not supported by the specified I/O Command Set combination,\nthen the controller shall abort the command with a status code of I/O Command Set Combination Rejected.\nUpon successful completion of a Set Features command for this Feature, the controller transitions to using\nthe specified I/O Command Set Combination.\nIf a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, then the attributes described in Figure 430 are\nreturned in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.",
