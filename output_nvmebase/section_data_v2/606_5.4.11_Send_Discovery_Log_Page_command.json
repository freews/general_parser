    "text": "The Send Discovery Log Page (SDLP) command is used by a CDC to send a discovery log page to a pull\nmodel DDC. This command uses the Data Pointer, Command Dword 10, Command Dword 11, Command\nDword 12, and Command Dword 13, as shown in Figure 567, Figure 568, Figure 569, Figure 570, and\nFigure 571 respectively.\nThe transferred log page has the same format of the correspondent discovery log page retrieved by a Get\nLog Page command (refer to section 5.2.12). The discovery log pages allowed to be transferred by a SDLP\ncommand are shown in Figure 572.\nIf a not allowed log page is requested, the CDC shall set the RLPS field (refer to Figure 568) to 02h (i.e.,\nNot Allowed Log Page) and transfer no log page.\nThe pull model DDC receiving a SDLP command may request the CDC to resend the requested log page\nwhen that log page is updated on the CDC. This is done through the LPUR bit in Dword 0 of the completion\nqueue entry for the SDLP command, as shown in Figure 573.",
