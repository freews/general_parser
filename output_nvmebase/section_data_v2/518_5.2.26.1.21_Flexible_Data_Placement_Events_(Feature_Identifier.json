    "text": "This Feature controls if a controller generates Flexible Data Placement (FDP) events associated with a\nspecific Reclaim Unit Handle. The Reclaim Unit Handle is the Reclaim Unit Handle associated with the\nspecified Placement Handle for the specified namespace. For a Set Features command, the data buffer\ncontains the list of FDP Event Types that are to be enabled or disabled as defined in Figure 439.\nThe attribute is specified in Command Dword 12. Effects of enabling and disabling FDP events on the\nReclaim Unit Handles are described in section 8.1.11.\nIf Flexible Data Placement is disabled, then the controller shall abort any Set Feature command or Get\nFeature command specifying this Feature with a status code of FDP Disabled.\nIf the NSID field is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of\nInvalid Field in Command.\nIf a Get Features command specifying this Feature is successfully completed, then the attributes for the\nsupported list of FDP Event Types described in Figure 440 is returned in the data buffer and Dword 0 of\nthe completion queue entry contains the value of NOET (i.e., the number of supported FDP Event Types\nthat are contained in the data buffer). Completion queue entry Dword 0 is defined in Figure 436. The\nsupported list of FDP Event Types shall be listed in ascending order of FDP Event Type.\nThis Feature shall be saveable (refer to section 4.4).\nIf:\n•\na Reclaim Unit Handle is shared by more than one namespace that exists in the same Endurance\nGroup; and\n•\na Set Features command specifies this Feature and one of those namespaces,\nthen a modification to this Feature occurs to that shared Reclaim Unit Handle and the Placement Handle\nthat is associated with the shared Reclaim Unit Handle.",
