The event contains a\nPersistent Event Log Event header and the Set Feature Event data (refer to Figure 250).\nThe Set Feature Event shall set the Persistent Event Log Event Header:\n•\nEvent Type field to 0Bh; and\n•\nEvent Type Revision Field to 01h.\nA Set Feature Event shall be recorded in the Persistent Event Log when the following criteria are met:\n•\nA Set Features command completes successfully;\n•\nThe Feature Identifier in that Set Features command is supported to be logged in the Persistent\nEvent Log; and\n•\nThere is a change to the controller settings for the Feature Identifier in that Set Features command\n(i.e., the same setting is not set again).\nA Set Feature Event may be recorded in the Persistent Event Log when there is no change to the controller\nsettings for the Feature Identifier in that Set Features command if the following criteria are met:\n•\nA Set Features command completes successfully; and\n•\nThe Feature Identifier in that Set Features command is supported to be logged in the Persistent\nEvent Log.\nThe Feature Identifiers that may be supported to be logged in the Persistent Event Log are shown in Figure\n249.\nThe Command Dwords and data buffer logged in the Set Feature Event data use the same formats as the\nformats defined by the Set Features and Get Features commands.",
