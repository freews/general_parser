If a '1' is written to a bit, then the corresponding interrupt vector is masked from generating an interrupt or reporting a pending interrupt in the MSI Capability Structure. Writing a '0' to a bit has no effect. When read, this field returns the current interrupt mask value within the controller (not the value of this property). If a bit has a value of a '1', then the corresponding interrupt vector is masked. If a bit has a value of '0', then the corresponding interrupt vector is not masked. |"
