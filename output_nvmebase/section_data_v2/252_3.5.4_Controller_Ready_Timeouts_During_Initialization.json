Controllers\ncompliant with revisions earlier than NVM Express Base Specification, Revision 2.0 may clear the\nCAP.CRMS field to 00b. This section is applicable to controllers that clear the CAP.CRMS field to 00b and\ncontrollers that set CAP.CRMS to a non-zero value.\nThere are three controller ready timeout fields\nThe details regarding these timeouts during controller initialization are as follows:\na) The CAP.TO field shall be set as described in Figure 36;\nb) If the CAP.CRMS field is cleared to 00b’, then the worst-case time the host should wait after the\ncontroller is enabled (i.e., CC.EN transitions from ‘0’ to ‘1’) for the controller to become ready\n(CSTS.RDY transitions from ‘0’ to ‘1’) is indicated by CAP.TO;\nc) If the controller is in Controller Ready With Media mode (i.e., the CC.CRIME bit is cleared to ‘0’),\nthen:\ni.\nthe Controller Ready Independent of Media Timeout (CRTO.CRIMT) field is not applicable;\nand\nii.\nthe Controller Ready With Media Timeout (CRTO.CRWMT) indicates the worst-case time\nthe host should wait after the controller is enabled for:\n1. the controller to become ready and be able to process all commands without error\nas described in section 3.5.4.1; and\n2. all attached namespaces and media required to process Admin commands to\nbecome ready;\nand\nd) If the controller is in Controller Ready Independent of Media mode (i.e., the CC.CRIME bit is set to\n‘1’), then\ni.\nthe Controller Ready With Media Timeout (CRTO.CRWMT) field indicates the worst-case\ntime that a host should wait for all attached namespaces and media required to process\nAdmin commands to become ready after the controller is enabled; and\nii.\nthe Controller Ready Independent of Media Timeout (CRTO.CRIMT) field indicates the\nworst-case time the host should wait after the controller is enabled for the controller to\nbecome ready and be able to process:\n1. all commands that do not access attached namespaces; and\n2.
