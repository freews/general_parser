    "text": "Each namespace that supports reservations has a Persist Through Power Loss (PTPL) state that may be\nmodified using either a Set Features command or a Reservation Register command (refer to section 7.6).\nThe Reservation Persistence feature attributes are specified in Command Dword 11.\nThe PTPL state is contained in the Reservation Persistence feature that is namespace specific. A Set\nFeatures command that uses the namespace ID FFFFFFFFh modifies the PTPL state associated with all\nnamespaces that are attached to the controller and that support PTPL (i.e., support reservations). A Set\nFeatures command that uses a valid namespace ID other than FFFFFFFFh and corresponds to a\nnamespace that supports reservations, modifies the PTPL state for that namespace. A Get Features\ncommand that uses a namespace ID of FFFFFFFFh shall be aborted with a status code of Invalid Field in\nCommand. A Get Features command that uses a valid namespace ID other than FFFFFFFFh and\ncorresponds to a namespace that supports PTPL, returns the PTPL state for that namespace. If a Set\nFeatures command or a Get Features command using a namespace ID other than FFFFFFFFh attempts\nto access the PTPL state for a namespace that does not support this Feature Identifier, then the command\nis aborted with status code of Invalid Field in Command.\nThis feature shall not be saveable (refer to Figure 199).\nIf a Get Features command successfully completes for this Feature Identifier, the attributes specified in\nFigure 469 are returned in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.",
