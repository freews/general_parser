    "text": "The scope of an NVM Subsystem Reset depends on whether the NVM subsystem supports multiple\ndomains. In an NVM subsystem that does not support multiple domains, the scope of the NVM Subsystem\nReset is the entire NVM subsystem.\nAn NVM Subsystem Reset is initiated when:\n•\nMain power is applied to the NVM subsystem;\n•\nA value of 4E564D65h (“NVMe”) is written to the NSSR.NSSRC field;\n•\nRequested using a method defined in the NVM Express Management Interface Specification; or\n•\nA vendor specific event occurs.\nWhen an NVM Subsystem Reset occurs, the entire NVM subsystem is reset. This includes the initiation of\na Controller Level Reset on all controllers that make up the NVM subsystem, disabling of the Persistent\nMemory Region associated with all controllers that make up the NVM subsystem, and any transport specific\nactions defined in the applicable NVM Express Transport specification.\nThe occurrence of an NVM Subsystem Reset while power is applied to the NVM subsystem is reported by\nthe initial value of the CSTS.NSSRO field following the NVM Subsystem Reset. This field may be used by\na host to determine if the sudden loss of communication with a controller was due to an NVM Subsystem\nReset or some other condition.\nThe ability for a host to initiate an NVM Subsystem Reset by writing to the NSSR.NSSRC field is an optional\ncapability of a controller indicated by the state of the CAP.NSSRS field. An implementation may protect the\nNVM subsystem from an inadvertent NVM Subsystem Reset by not providing this capability to one or more\ncontrollers that make up the NVM subsystem.\nThe occurrence of a vendor specific event that results in an NVM Subsystem Reset is intended to allow\nimplementations to recover from a severe NVM subsystem internal error that prevents continued normal\noperation (e.g., fatal hardware or firmware error).",
