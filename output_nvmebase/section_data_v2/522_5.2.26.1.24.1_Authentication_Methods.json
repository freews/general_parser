    "text": "This section defines optional authentication methods that allow a host to unfreeze a previously frozen\npersonality. Support for these authentication methods is indicated in the Authenticated Unfreeze Support\n(AUS) field in the Personality Properties data structure (refer to Figure 285). Section 8.1.6.2 describes the\nmechanisms to unfreeze a frozen personality.\nThe Security Send and Security Receive commands are used by the host to submit Personality Unfreeze\nRequest operations (refer to section 8.1.6.2). If the Security Send and Security Receive commands are not\nsupported, a frozen personality is permanently frozen.\nIf a personality supports Physical Credential Authentication (refer to the PCAS bit in Figure 285), then the\ncredential is a vendor-defined Physical Presence Indicator (PPI) as described in section 5.2.26.1.24.1.1.\nIf a personality supports Programmable Key Authentication (refer to the PKAS bit in Figure 285), then the\nauthentication key is derived from a host-programmable key as described in section 5.2.26.1.24.1.2.",
