    "text": "The Delete operation of the Manage Exported Port command is used to remove an Exported Port from an\nExported NVM Subsystem and delete the Exported Port.\nThe Exported Port to be deleted is specified in the Exported Port ID (EPID) field in the Delete operation\ndata structure (refer to Figure 566) in the data buffer.\nThe Exported NVM Subsystem NQN to which this Exported Port ID is assigned is specified in the NVM\nSubsystem NVMe Qualified Name (SUBNQN) field of the Delete operation data structure in the data buffer.\nThe Exported Port that is deleted by a Delete operation should not be in use (i.e., there should be no\nassociation between any host and a controller through that Exported Port). If the Exported Port is in use,\nthen all associations between any host and a controller through that port are terminated by the Delete\noperation, and for any association that is terminated, the behavior of outstanding commands submitted via\nthat association and resources underlying that association (e.g., fabric connections) is undefined.\nIf:\n•\nthe Exported port ID field in the Delete operation data structure does not contain an Exported Port\nID associated with the Exported NVM Subsystem NQN (SUBNQN) specified in the Delete data\nstructure (refer to Figure 566); or\n•\nthe NVM Subsystem NVMe Qualified Name field in the Delete data structure (refer to Figure 566)\ndoes not contain an NVM Subsystem NQN for an existing Exported NVM Subsystem that is\nassociated with the Exported Port ID specified in the Delete data structure,\nthen the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.\nUpon successful completion of a Manage Exported Port command with a Delete operation the specified\nExported Port ID has been removed from the specified Exported NVM Subsystem.",
