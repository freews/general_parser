    "text": "A property is a dword, or qword attribute of a controller. The attribute may have read, write, or read/write\naccess. The host shall access a property using the width specified for that property with an offset that is at\nthe beginning of the property unless otherwise noted in a transport specific specification. All reserved\nproperties and all reserved bits within properties are read-only and return 0h when read.\nFor message-based controllers, properties may be read with the Property Get command and may be written\nwith the Property Set command.\nFor memory-based controllers, refer to the applicable NVMe Transport binding specification for access\nmethods and rules (e.g., NVMe over PCIe Transport Specification).\nFigure 33 and Figure 34 describe the property map for a memory-based controller. Figure 33 and Figure\n35 describe the property map for a message-based controller.\nAccesses that target any portion of two or more properties are not supported.\nSoftware should not rely on 0h being returned.\nThe following conventions are used to describe controller properties for all transport models. Hardware\nshall return ‘0’ for all bits that are marked as reserved, and a host shall write all reserved bits and properties\nwith the value of 0h.\nThe following terms and abbreviations are used:\nRO\nRead Only\nRW\nRead Write\nRWC\nRead/Write ‘1’ to clear\nRWS\nRead/Write ‘1’ to set\nImpl Spec\nImplementation Specific – the controller has the freedom to choose\nits implementation.\nHwInit\nThe default state is dependent on NVM Express controller and\nsystem configuration.\nReset\nThis column indicates the value of the field after a Controller Level\nReset as defined in section 3.7.2.\nFor some fields, it is implementation specific as to whether the field is RW, RWC, or RO; this is typically\nshown as RW/RO or RWC/RO to indicate that if the functionality is not supported that the field is read only.\nWhen a field is referred to in the document, the convention used is “Property Symbol.Field Symbol”. For\nexample, the PCI command register Parity Error Response Enable bit is referred to by the name CMD.PEE.\nIf the field is an array of bits, the field is referred to as “Property Symbol.Field Symbol (array offset to\nelement)”. When a sub-field is referred to in the document, the convention used is “Property Symbol.Field\nSymbol.Sub Field Symbol”. For example, when the Controller Ready With Media Support sub-field of the\nController Ready Modes Supported field within the Controller Capability property, the sub-field is referred\nto by the name CAP.CRMS.CRWMS.",
