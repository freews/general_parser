The NVM Set\nList describes the attributes for each NVM Set in the list based on the NVM Set Attributes Entry in Figure\n333.\nThe NVM Set List shall not contain an entry cleared to 0h.",

A value of 0h indicates that no Optimal Write Size is specified. This field should be cleared to 0h when namespaces within an NVM Set have different User Data Formats that do not allow an Optimal Write Size to be specified. |\n| 31:16 | **Total NVM Set Capacity (TNVMSC):** This field indicates the total NVM capacity in this NVM Set.
