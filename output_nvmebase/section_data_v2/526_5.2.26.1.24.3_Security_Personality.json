    "text": "The Security Personality allows a host to configure the NVM subsystem with one or more of the security\nprotocols supported indicated in Figure 450.\nIf an NVM subsystem is configured with that Security Personality and a supported security protocol has\nbeen enabled, then any Security Send and Security Receive command issued by the host that specifies\nthat security protocol shall be allowed.\nIf a security protocol is allowed, then once the security protocol is no longer in the defined default\nmanufacturing state (e.g., transition out of the Manufacturing-Inactive state for the TCG Security Protocol\n(refer to the TCG Storage Security Subsystem Class: Opal Specification)), then the controller shall freeze\nthe Security Personality and a CDP Change Event shall be recorded in the Persistent Event log page for\nthe Security Personality (refer to section 5.2.12.1.14.2.15).\nIf a supported security protocol is prohibited, then any Security Send and Security Receive command issued\nby the host that specifies that security protocol shall be prohibited. If a Security Send or Security Receive\ncommand is processed that uses a security protocol that is prohibited, then the controller shall abort the\ncommand with a status code of Access Denied.\nIf a Get Features command specifies this personality, then the Security Personality data structure defined\nin Figure 450 shall be returned in the data buffer for that command.\nIf a Set Features command is processed for the Security Personality, then the Security Personality\nAttributes data structure (refer to Figure 451) is specified in the data buffer for that command. If the host\nspecifies a Supported Security Protocol (SSP) field value that is not supported, then the controller shall\nabort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.\nA security protocol that is allowed shall only able to be unfrozen if that security protocol is reset to the\ndefault security settings for the given security protocol. Refer to the appropriate security specification (e.g.,\nPSID Feature Set to reset the device to Original Factory Settings (OFS) using the Revert method defined\nin TCG Storage Opal SSC Feature Set: PSID Specification).",
