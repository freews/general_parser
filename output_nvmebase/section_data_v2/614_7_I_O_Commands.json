    "text": "An I/O command is a command submitted to an I/O Submission Queue. Figure 589 lists the I/O commands\nthat are defined for use in all I/O Command Sets. The following subsections provide definitions for each\ncommand. Refer to section 3.1.3.4 for mandatory, optional, and prohibited I/O commands for the various\ncontroller types. The following subsections describe the definition for each of these commands.\nThe user data format and any end-to-end protection information is I/O Command Set specific. Refer to each\nI/O Command Set specification for applicability and additional details, if any. Refer to the referenced NVM\nExpress I/O Command Set specification for all I/O Command Set specific commands described in Figure\n589.\nCommands shall only be submitted by the host when the controller is ready as indicated in the Controller\nStatus property (CSTS.RDY) and after appropriate I/O Submission Queue(s) and I/O Completion Queue(s)\nhave been created.\nThe submission queue entry (SQE) structure and the fields that are common to all I/O commands are\ndefined in section 4.1. The completion queue entry (CQE) structure and the fields that are common to all\nI/O commands are defined in section 4.2. The command specific fields in the SQE and CQE structures (i.e.,\nSQE Command Dwords 10-15, CQE Dword 0, and CQE Dword 1) for I/O commands supported across all\nI/O Command Sets are defined in this section.",
