    "text": "I/O Command Directives are the subset of Directive Types that may be used as part of I/O commands. For\nexample, a Write command in the NVM Command Set may specify a Directive Type and an associated\nDirective Specific value. I/O Command Directives shall have a Directive Type value that is less than or\nequal to 0Fh due to the size of the Directive Type field in I/O commands. When a Directive Type is specified\nin an I/O command, the most significant four bits are assumed to be 0h. A Directive Type of 00h in an I/O\ncommand specifies that the I/O command is not using Directives.\nIn an I/O command, if the Directive Type (DTYPE) field is set to an I/O Command Directive, then the\nDirective Specific (DSPEC) field includes additional information for the associated I/O command (refer to\nFigure 646).\nIn an I/O command:\n•\nif no I/O Command Directive is enabled or the DTYPE field is cleared to 00h, then the DTYPE field\nand the DSPEC field are ignored; and\n•\nif one or more I/O Command Directives is enabled and the DTYPE field is set to a value that is not\nsupported or not enabled, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid\nField in Command.\nFor the Streams Directive (i.e., DTYPE field set to 01h), if the DSPEC field is cleared to 0h in an I/O\ncommand that supports the Streams Directive, then that I/O command shall be processed normally (i.e., as\nif DTYPE field is cleared to 00h).",
