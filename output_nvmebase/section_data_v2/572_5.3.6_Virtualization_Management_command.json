    "text": "The Virtualization Management command is supported by primary controllers that support the Virtualization\nEnhancements capability. This command is used for several functions:\n•\nModifying Flexible Resource allocation for the primary controller;\n•\nAssigning Flexible Resources for secondary controllers; and\n•\nSetting the Online and Offline state for secondary controllers.\nRefer to section 8.2.6 for more on the Virtualization Enhancements capability and the Virtualization\nManagement command.\nThe Virtualization Management command uses the Command Dword 10 and Command Dword 11 fields.\nAll other command specific fields are reserved.\nIf the action requested specifies a range of controller resources that:\na) does not exist;\nb) is a Private Resource (e.g., VQ resources are requested when VQ resources are not supported, VI\nresources are requested when VI resources are not supported); or\nc) is currently in use (e.g., the number of Controller Resources (NR) is greater than the number of\nremaining available flexible resources),\nthen the command is aborted with a status code of Invalid Resource Identifier.",
