Configures the Admin Submission Queue and the Admin Completion Queues by initializing the\nAdmin Queue Attributes (AQA), Admin Submission Queue Base Address (ASQ), and Admin\nCompletion Queue Base Address (ACQ) properties appropriately;\n2. Configures the size of the I/O Submission Queues (CC.IOSQES) and I/O Completion Queues\n(CC.IOCQES);\n3. Submits a Set Features command with the Number of Queues attribute set to the requested\nnumber of I/O Submission Queues and I/O Completion Queues. The completion queue entry for\nthis Set Features command indicates the number of I/O Submission Queues and I/O Completion\nQueues allocated by the controller;\n4. Determines the maximum number of entries supported per queue (CAP.MQES) and whether the\nqueues are required to be physically contiguous (CAP.CQR);\n5. Creates I/O Completion Queues within the limitations of the number allocated by the controller and\nthe queue attributes supported (maximum entries and physically contiguous requirements) by using\nthe Create I/O Completion Queue command; and\n6. Creates I/O Submission Queues within the limitations of the number allocated by the controller and\nthe queue attributes supported (maximum entries and physically contiguous requirements) by using\nthe Create I/O Submission Queue command.\nAt the end of this process, I/O Submission Queues and I/O Completion Queues have been setup and\ninitialized and may be used to complete I/O commands.",
