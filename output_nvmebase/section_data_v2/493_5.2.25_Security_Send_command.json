    "text": "The Security Send command is used to transfer security protocol data to the controller. The data structure\ntransferred to the controller as part of this command contains security protocol specific commands to be\nperformed by the controller. The data structure transferred may also contain data or parameters associated\nwith the security protocol commands. Status and data that is to be returned to the host for the security\nprotocol commands submitted by a Security Send command are retrieved with the Security Receive\ncommand defined in section 5.2.23.\nThe association between a Security Send command and subsequent Security Receive command is\nSecurity Protocol field dependent as defined in SPC-5.\nIf the Configurable Device Personality feature (refer to section 5.2.26.1.24) is supported and the Security\nPersonality is supported (refer to section 5.2.12.1.28), then the Security Send command may have\nadditional command processing considerations as described in section 5.2.26.1.24.3.\nThe fields used are Data Pointer, Command Dword 10, and Command Dword 11 fields. All other command\nspecific fields are reserved.",
