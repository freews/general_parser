Figure 144 describes Admin command processing restrictions\nfor all controllers while any namespace is a sanitization target of an in progress namespace sanitize\noperation. Figure 145 describes Admin command processing restrictions for controllers with an attached\nnamespace that is a sanitization target of an in progress namespace sanitize operation. Admin commands\nnot shown in Figure 144 or Figure 145 (e.g., Vendor Specific commands) are aborted with a status code of\nSanitize Namespace In Progress if the implementation of that Admin command affects a namespace which\nis a sanitization target of an in progress namespace sanitize operation.",
