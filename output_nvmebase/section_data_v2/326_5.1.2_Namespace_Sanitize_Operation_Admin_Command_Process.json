    "text": "Figure 144 lists Admin commands that have processing restrictions while a namespace sanitize operation\nis in progress.\nIf an Admin command is being processed that either:\n•\naffects (e.g., changes or deletes) a namespace that is the sanitization target of an in progress\nnamespace sanitize operation (e.g., a command that affects all namespaces or a command with\nan NSID set to the NSID of a namespace which is being sanitized); or\n•\ncauses the user data to be accessed (e.g., read) for a namespace that is the sanitization target of\nan in progress namespace sanitize operation,\nthen that command shall be aborted with a status code of Sanitize Namespace In Progress.\nSome Admin commands only affect attached namespaces while other Admin commands are capable of\naffecting namespaces that are not attached. Figure 144 describes Admin command processing restrictions\nfor all controllers while any namespace is a sanitization target of an in progress namespace sanitize\noperation. Figure 145 describes Admin command processing restrictions for controllers with an attached\nnamespace that is a sanitization target of an in progress namespace sanitize operation. Admin commands\nnot shown in Figure 144 or Figure 145 (e.g., Vendor Specific commands) are aborted with a status code of\nSanitize Namespace In Progress if the implementation of that Admin command affects a namespace which\nis a sanitization target of an in progress namespace sanitize operation.",
