    "text": "This log page consists of a header (i.e., bytes 511:0 of the log page) describing the log and zero or more\nTelemetry Data Blocks (refer to section 8.1.29). The header shall always be available even if there is no\nTelemetry Host-Initiated Data available. All Telemetry Data Blocks are 512 bytes in size. The controller\nshall initiate a capture of internal controller-scoped or NVM subsystem-scoped state to this log page if the\ncontroller processes a Get Log Page command for this log with the Create Telemetry Host-Initiated Data\nbit set to ‘1’ in the Log Specific Parameter field. The scope of the saved state is determined by the value in\nthe Telemetry Host-Initiated Scope field. If the host specifies a Log Page Offset Lower value that is not a\nmultiple of 512 bytes in the Get Log Page command for this log page, then the controller shall abort the\ncommand with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.\nThe Log Specific Parameter field in Command Dword 10 (refer to Figure 201) for this log page is defined\nin Figure 217.\nThe Telemetry Host-Initiated Data consists of:\na) Three areas, if the Data Area 4 Support (DA4S) bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the Log Page Attributes field:\nTelemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 1, Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 2, and Telemetry Host-\nInitiated Data Area 3; or\nb) Four areas, if the DA4S bit is set to ‘1’ in the Log Page Attributes field: Telemetry Host-Initiated\nData Area 1, Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 2, Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 3 and\nTelemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 4.\nAll areas start at Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area Block 1. The last block of each area is indicated in\nTelemetry Host-Initiated Data Area y Last Block, respectively. The telemetry data captured and the size of\nthat data is implementation dependent.\nThe size of the log page is variable and:\n•\nIf the DA4S bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the Log Page Attributes field, the size may be calculated using\nthe Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 3 Last Block field.\n•\nIf the DA4S bit is set to ‘1’ in the Log Page Attributes field and the Extended Telemetry Data Area\n4 Supported (ETDAS) field is set to 1h in the Host Behavior Support feature (refer to section\n5.2.26.1.14), then the size of the log page may be calculated using the Telemetry Host-Initiated\nData Area 4 Last Block field.\n•\nIf the DA4S bit is set to ‘1’ in the Log Page Attributes field and the Extended Telemetry Data Area\n4 Supported (ETDAS) field is cleared to 0h in the Host Behavior Support feature (refer to section\n5.2.26.1.14), then the size of the log page may be calculated using the Telemetry Host-Initiated\nData Area 3 Last Block field.\nThe controller shall return data for all blocks requested:\n•\nIf the DA4S bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the Log Page Attributes field, then the data beyond the last block\nin Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 3 Last Block is undefined.\n•\nIf the DA4S bit is set to ‘1’ in the Log Page Attributes field and the Extended Telemetry Data Area\n4 Supported (ETDAS) field is set to 1h in the Host Behavior Support feature, then the data beyond\nthe last block in Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 4 Last Block is undefined.\n•\nIf the DA4S bit is set to ‘1’ in the Log Page Attributes field and the Extended Telemetry Data Area\n4 Supported (ETDAS) field is cleared to 0h in the Host Behavior Support feature, then the data\nbeyond the last block in Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 3 Last Block is undefined.\nIf the host requests a data transfer that is not a multiple of 512 bytes, then the controller shall return an\nerror of Invalid Field in Command.\nIf the MCDAS bit (refer to Figure 219) is set to ‘1’ and a Get Log Page command with the Create Telemetry\nHost-Initiated Data bit is set to ‘1’, then the maximum data area to be created in the Telemetry Host-Initiated\nlog page shall be less than or equal to the MCDA field in the Log Specific Parameter field in Command\nDword 10 (refer to Figure 217).",
