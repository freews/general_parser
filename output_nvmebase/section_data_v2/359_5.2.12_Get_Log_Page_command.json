    "text": "The Get Log Page command returns a data buffer containing the log page requested. The Get Log Page\ncommand may be impacted by the ANA state (refer to section 8.1.1.10).\nThe Get Log Page command uses the Data Pointer, Command Dword 10, Command Dword 11, Command\nDword 12, Command Dword 13, and Command Dword 14 fields. All other command specific fields are\nreserved.\nThere are mandatory and optional Log Page Identifiers defined in section 3.1.3.5. If a Get Log Page\ncommand is processed that specifies a Log Page Identifier that is not supported, then the controller shall\nabort the command with a status code of Invalid Log Page with the exception defined in Figure 321.\nThe controller indicates support for the Log Page Offset and extended Number of Dwords (32 bits rather\nthan 12 bits) in the Log Page Attributes field of the Identify Controller data structure. If extended data is not\nsupported, then bits 27:16 of the Number of Dwords Lower field specify the Number of Dwords to transfer.\nIf the Log Page Offset is supported, then:\n•\na byte offset shall be supported (i.e., Offset Type field cleared to ‘0’) for all log pages; and\n•\nfor each log page that has the IOS bit set to ‘1’ in the LID Supported and Effects data structure\n(refer to Figure 208) for the specified LID in the Supported Log Pages log page an index offset shall\nbe supported (i.e., Offset Type field set to ‘1’).\nIf the IOS bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the LID Supported and Effects data structure for the specified LID in the\nSupported Log Pages log page and a Get Log Page command specifies Offset Type field set to ‘1’, then\nthat command shall be aborted with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.\nIf the controller supports selection of a UUID by the Get Log Page command (refer to Figure 206 and section\n8.1.30), then Command Dword 14 is used to specify a UUID Index value (refer to Figure 205).\nFigure 206 defines the log pages that are able to be retrieved with the Get Log Page command and the\nscope of the information that is returned in those log pages. Section 5.2.12.1 describes log pages that are\ncommon to all transport models. Section 5.2.12.2 describes log pages that are specific to the Memory-\nbased transport model. Section 5.2.12.3 describes log pages that are specific to the Message-based\ntransport model.",
