    "text": "Figure 628 shows an overview of the Boot Partition write protection states for each Boot Partition when\nboth Boot Partition write protection mechanisms are supported. Supporting both Boot Partition write\nprotection mechanisms is discouraged, as specified in section 8.1.3.3.\nIf both Boot Partition write protection mechanisms are supported by the controller, only one Boot Partition\nwrite protection mechanism controls the write protection states of the Boot Partitions for the controller at\nany time. If RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection is enabled, then RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection\ncontrols the Boot Partition write protection states (refer to section 8.1.3.3.2 and section 8.1.23). If RPMB\nBoot Partition Write Protection is disabled, then Set Features Boot Partition Write Protection controls the\nBoot Partition write protection states (refer to section 8.1.3.3.1 and section 5.2.26.1.36). Control of the Boot\nPartition write protection states transitions from Set Features Boot Partition Write Protection to RPMB Boot\nPartition Write Protection by enabling RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection when the Boot Partitions are\nin either a Write Unlocked or Write Locked state.\nIf both Boot Partition write protection capabilities are supported and an RPMB authentication key has not\nbeen programmed for RPMB target 0, there is a possibility of malicious bypass of a Boot Partition’s Write\nLocked Until Power Cycle state. In order to prevent malicious bypass of a Boot Partition's Write Locked\nUntil Power Cycle state, a controller that supports both Boot Partition write protection mechanisms is\nrequired to prevent host attempts to enable RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection when either Boot Partition\nis in a Write Locked Until Power Cycle state. Refer to section 8.1.23 for the specific behavior that the\ncontroller exhibits under this condition.",
