    "text": "This log page is used to describe extended error information for a command that completed with error or\nreport an error that is not specific to a particular command. Extended error information is provided when\nthe More (M) bit is set to ‘1’ in the Status field for the completion queue entry associated with the command\nthat completed with error or as part of an asynchronous event with an Error status type. This log page is\nglobal to the controller.\nThis error log may return the last n errors. If the host specifies a data transfer of the size of n error logs,\nthen the error logs for the most recent n errors are returned. The ordering of the entries is based on the\ntime when the error occurred, with the most recent error being returned as the first log entry.\nEach entry in the log page returned is defined in Figure 209. The log page is a set of 64-byte entries; the\nmaximum number of entries supported is indicated in the ELPE field in the Identify Controller data structure\n(refer to Figure 328). If the log page is full when a new entry is generated, the controller should insert the\nnew entry into the log and discard the oldest entry.\nThe controller should clear this log page by removing all entries on power cycle and Controller Level Reset.",
