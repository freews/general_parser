If ANA is used\nwith dispersed namespaces, then globally unique namespace identifiers (refer to section 8.1.10.2) are used\nto determine when multiple paths are available to the same dispersed namespace. Hosts specify to\ncontrollers that their host (e.g., multipath I/O software) uses globally unique namespace identifiers to\ndetermine when multiple paths are available to the dispersed namespace by setting the HDISNS field to 1h\nin the Host Behavior Support feature, as described in section 8.1.10.3.\nANA Group usage with dispersed namespaces is described in section 8.1.1.2.",
