    "text": "An Administrative controller is a controller whose intended purpose is to provide NVM subsystem\nmanagement capabilities. While an I/O controller may support these same management capabilities, an\nAdministrative controller has fewer mandatory capabilities. Unlike an I/O controller, an Administrative\ncontroller does not support I/O commands. NVMe Transports may support a transport specific mechanism\nto allow an Administrative controller to load a dedicated NVMe management driver instead of a generic\nNVMe driver (refer to the applicable NVMe Transport binding specification for details).\nExamples of management capabilities that may be supported by an Administrative controller include the\nfollowing.\n•\nAbility to efficiently poll NVM subsystem health status via NVMe-MI using the NVMe-MI Send\ncommand and the NVMe-MI Receive command (refer to the NVM Subsystem Health Status Poll\nsection in the NVM Express Management Interface Specification);\n•\nAbility to manage an NVMe enclosure via NVMe-MI using the NVMe-MI Send command and the\nNVMe-MI Receive command;\n•\nAbility to manage NVM subsystem namespaces using the Namespace Attachment command and\nthe Namespace Management command;\n•\nAbility to perform virtualization management using the Virtualization Management command;\n•\nAbility to reset an entire NVM subsystem using the NVM Subsystem Reset (NSSR) property if\nsupported; and\n•\nAbility to shutdown an entire NVM subsystem using the NVM Subsystem Shutdown (NSSD)\nproperty, if supported.\nAn Administrative controller shall not support I/O Queues. Namespaces shall not be attached to an\nAdministrative controller.\nAn Administrative controller is required to support the mandatory Admin commands listed in Figure 28. An\nAdministrative controller may support one or more I/O Command Sets. If an Administrative controller\nsupports an I/O Command Set, then the I/O Command Set specific Admin commands associated with that\nI/O Command Set may also be supported. I/O commands shall not be supported since an Administrative\ncontroller only has an Admin Queue and no I/O Queues.\nFigure 25 shows an NVM subsystem with one Administrative controller and two I/O controllers within an\nNVM subsystem that contains a non-volatile storage medium and namespaces. I/O controller one has two\nattached namespaces, private namespace A and shared namespace B. I/O controller two also has two\nattached namespaces, private namespace C and shared namespace B. An Administrative controller has\nno attached namespaces. The Administrative controller in this example may be used for tasks such as NVM\nsubsystem namespace management and efficiently polling NVM subsystem health status via NVMe-MI.\nWhile this example shows a single Administrative controller, an NVM subsystem may support zero or more\nAdministrative controllers.\nFigure 26 shows an NVM subsystem with one Administrative controller within an NVM subsystem that\ncontains no non-volatile storage medium or namespaces. The Administrative controller in this example may\nbe used to manage an NVMe enclosure using NVMe-MI. Since the Administrative controller is used for a\nvery specific dedicated purpose, the implementer of such an Administrative controller may choose to\nimplement only the mandatory capabilities along with the NVMe-MI Send and NVMe-MI Receive\ncommands.",
