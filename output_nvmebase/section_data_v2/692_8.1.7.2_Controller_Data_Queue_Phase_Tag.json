    "text": "The Controller Data Queue Phase Tag (CDQP) bit indicates whether a CDQ entry is new. The CDQP bit\nfor each CDQ entry in the CDQ shall be initialized to ‘0’ by the host before creating the CDQ by submitting\na Controller Data Queue command (refer to section 5.2.4) specifying the Create Queue management\noperation (refer to section 5.2.4.1.1).\nWhen the controller posts a new CDQ entry to the CDQ, the controller shall invert the CDQP bit in that CDQ\nentry (i.e., the inverting of the CDQP bit enables the host to detect the new CDQ entry).\nWhen a CDQ entry is posted to a CDQ slot in the CDQ for the first time after the CDQ is created, the CDQP\nbit for that completion queue entry is set to ‘1’.\nThis continues for each CDQ entry that is posted until the controller posts a CDQ entry to the highest\nnumbered CDQ slot and wraps to CDQ slot number 0 as described in section 8.1.7.1. When that CDQ wrap\ncondition occurs, the CDQP bit is then cleared to ‘0’ in each CDQ entry that is posted. This continues until\nanother CDQ wrap condition occurs. Each time a CDQ wrap condition occurs, the value of the CDQP bit is\ninverted (i.e., changes from ‘1’ to ‘0’ or changes from ‘0’ to ‘1’).",
