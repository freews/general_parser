    "text": "The Universally Unique Identifier is defined in RFC 9562 and contained in the Namespace Identification\nDescriptor (refer to Figure 331). Byte ordering requirements for a UUID are described in RFC 9562.\nFor historical reasons, UUID subtypes are called UUID versions. Multiple UUID versions are able to be\nused in the same implementation.\nRFC 9562 defines UUID version 8 (i.e., UUIDv8) for experimental or vendor-specific use cases. Uniqueness\nof UUIDv8 values is implementation specific. NVM Express UUID use cases assume uniqueness within the\nset of hosts, NVM subsystems, and fabrics that are connected or accessible by a common instance of an\nadministrative tool. For UUIDv8 values, that uniqueness is the responsibility of all of the implementations\nin that set. RFC 9562 Appendix B provides examples of UUIDv8 generation algorithms that produce unique\nUUIDs if all implementations in that set generate UUIDv8 values with the same algorithm.",
