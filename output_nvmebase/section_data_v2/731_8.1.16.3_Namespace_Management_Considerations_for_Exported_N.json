    "text": "A host is able to determine whether an Exported NVM Subsystem supports the Namespace Attachment\ncommand by reading the Commands Supported and Effects log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.6). The\nNamespace Attachment command is used to attach namespaces to controllers and detach namespaces\nfrom controllers. The Namespace Management command is not supported by controllers in an Exported\nNVM subsystem.\nIf an Exported Namespace is detached from a controller in the Exported NVM Subsystem, then the NSID\nthat referred to that namespace becomes an inactive NSID (refer to section 3.2.1.4) on that controller. If an\nUnderlying Namespace is disassociated from the Exported NVM Subsystem (refer to section 5.4.8.1.2),\nthen the NSID of the Exported Namespace that referred to that namespace becomes an unallocated NSID\n(refer to section 3.2.1.3) and is not available to any controller in the Exported NVM Subsystem. Previously\nsubmitted but uncompleted or subsequently submitted commands to the namespace that is:\n•\ndetached from a controller; or\n•\ndisassociated from the Exported NVM Subsystem,\nare handled by the controller as if they were issued to an inactive NSID (refer to section 3.2.1.4 and Figure\n92). Refer to section 8.1.16 for Host actions to attach or detach a specified Namespace.\nIf an Exported NVM Subsystem Exports an Underlying Namespace that becomes unavailable (e.g.,\ndetached or deleted) or is affected by a Capacity Management command (e.g., Endurance Group deletion,\nNVM Set deletion (refer to section 8.1.4)) then:\n•\nPreviously submitted but uncompleted or subsequently submitted commands to the Exported\nNamespace are handled by the controller as if they were issued to an inactive NSID (refer to section\n3.2.1.4 and Figure 92); and\n•\nIf Allocated Namespace Attribute Notices are enabled, then controllers affected by Underlying\nNamespace changes report an Allocated Namespace Attribute Changed asynchronous event to\nthe host as described in Figure 154.",
