    "text": "Endurance may be managed within a single NVM Set (refer to section 3.2.2) or across a collection of NVM\nSets. Each NVM Set is associated with an Endurance Group (refer to Figure 333). If two or more NVM Sets\nhave the same Endurance Group Identifier, then endurance is managed by the NVM subsystem across\nthat collection of NVM Sets. If only one NVM Set is associated with a specific Endurance Group Identifier,\nthen endurance is managed locally to that NVM Set.\nIf NVM Sets are not supported, then endurance is managed by the NVM subsystem:\n•\nwithin each Endurance Group if Endurance Groups are supported; or\n•\nwithin the domain if Endurance Groups are not supported.\nAn Endurance Group shall be part of only one domain (refer to section 3.2.5).\nAn Endurance Group Identifier is a 16-bit value that specifies the Endurance Group with which an action is\nassociated. An Endurance Group Identifier is unique within the NVM subsystem. An Endurance Group\nIdentifier value of 0h is reserved and is not a valid Endurance Group Identifier. Unless otherwise specified,\nif the host specifies an Endurance Group Identifier cleared to 0h for a command that requires an Endurance\nGroup Identifier, then that command shall abort with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.\nThe information that describes an Endurance Group is indicated in the Endurance Group Information log\npage (refer to section 5.2.12.1.10).\nFigure 69 shows Endurance Groups added to the example in Figure 67. In this example, the endurance of\nNVM Set A and NVM Set B are managed together as part of Endurance Group Y, while the endurance of\nNVM Set C is managed only within NVM Set C which is the only NVM Set that is part of Endurance Group\nZ.\nIf Endurance Groups are supported, then the NVM subsystem and all controllers shall:\n•\nindicate support for Endurance Groups in the Controller Attributes field in the Identify Controller\ndata structure;\n•\nindicate the Endurance Group Identifier with which the namespace is associated in the Identify\nNamespace data structure;\n•\nsupport the Endurance Group Information log page; and\n•\nsupport the Endurance Group Event Aggregate log page if more than one Endurance Group is\nsupported in the NVM subsystem.\nIf Endurance Groups are not supported and the host sends a command in which an Endurance Group\nIdentifier field is defined (e.g., Get Log Page), then that field shall be ignored by the controller.\nIf Endurance Groups are not supported and the controller returns information to the host that contains an\nEndurance Group Identifier field, then that field shall be cleared to 0h.",
