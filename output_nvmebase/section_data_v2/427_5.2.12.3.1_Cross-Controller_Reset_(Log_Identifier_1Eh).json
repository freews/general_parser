    "text": "The Cross-Controller Reset log page indicates the status of Cross-Controller Reset operations this\ncontroller caused to be initiated by the NVM subsystem.\nThis log page contains entries for in-progress and completed Cross-Controller Reset operations (refer to\nsection 8.3.3) as described in this section. The Source Controller (i.e., the controller processing a Cross-\nController Reset command) adds an entry for the Impacted Controller (i.e., the controller specified in the\nImpacted Controller ID (ICID) field of that command) to this log page under the conditions described in\nsection 5.4.3. If Cross-Controller Reset Completed Notices are enabled and the result of a Cross-Controller\nReset operation is recorded in the associated entry in this log page (as described in section 8.3.3), then the\nSource Controller reports a Cross-Controller Reset Completed Notice asynchronous event (refer to Figure\n154).\nFor each entry in this log page, that entry shall remain in the log page while the associated operation is in\nprogress (i.e., the Cross-Controller Reset Status (CCRS) field in that entry is set to In Progress). The\ncontroller shall remove the entry for a completed operation as a result of:\n•\nthe Source Controller processing a Get Log Page command for this log page with the Remove\nCompleted bit set to ‘1’, as defined in Figure 303;\n•\nthe Source Controller processing a subsequent Cross-Controller Reset command for the Impacted\nController indicated by the ICID field of that entry; or\n•\na Controller Level Reset (refer to section 3.7.2) occurring on the Source Controller.\nAs a result of an NVM Subsystem Reset (refer to section 3.7.1) on a domain:\n•\nthe NVM subsystem shall terminate all in-progress Cross-Controller Reset operations a Source\nController in the domain caused to be initiated; and\n•\neach Source Controller in the domain shall remove all entries from this log page.\nUpon reading this log page, if an entry indicates the Cross-Controller Reset operation is completed and:\n•\nthe value of the ICID field of that entry identifies a controller that the host is recovering from a loss\nof communication; and\n•\nthe value of the Controller Instance Uniquifier (CIU) field of that entry is the same as the value of\nthe CIU field of the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328) for that controller,\nthen the host processes that entry as described in section 9.6.2.2. The host should ignore other entries in\nthis log page.\nIf the host connected to a Discovery subsystem using the well-known Discovery Service NQN, then the\ncontroller shall not report that this log page is supported in the Supported Log Pages log page (refer to\nsection 5.2.12.1.1).\nThe Log Specific Parameter field in Command Dword 10 (refer to Figure 201) for this log page is defined\nin Figure 303.\nThis log page is defined in Figure 304.\nThe format of the Cross-Controller Reset Entry is defined in Figure 305.",
