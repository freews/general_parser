    "text": "Figure 718 illustrates how transitions in the PLN variable initiate Power Loss Signaling processing by the\ncontroller. Each circle represents a processing state.\nFor all states, a power cycle causes a transition to the PLS Not Ready state.\nThe Power Loss Signaling processing state of the controller determines the value of the PLA variable and\nwhether communications on the port are processed (refer to Figure 719).\nNote: I/O command processing in all of the PLS states, other than the PLS Not Ready state, complies with\natomic operation requirements for power fail, if any, as specified in the applicable NVM Express I/O\nCommand Set specification.\nThe conditions which trigger state transitions are described in the following sections. If a transition between\ntwo states can be caused by any one of multiple conditions, then those conditions are shown in a bullet list\nwith an “or” (e.g., the transition from the FQ Processing state to the PLS Not Ready state, refer to Figure\n722). If a transition is caused by multiple conditions which all must occur, then those conditions are shown\nas a single-item bullet list with an “and” (e.g., any of the transitions from the PLS Ready state, refer to Figure\n721).",
