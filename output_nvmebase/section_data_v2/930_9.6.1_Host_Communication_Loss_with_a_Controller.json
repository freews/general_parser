    "text": "A host determines that communication has been lost with a controller if:\n•\nthe host detects a Keep Alive Timeout (refer to section 3.9);\n•\nfor message-based transports, the host or the controller terminates the NVMe Transport connection\non which the command was sent (refer to section 3.3.2.4);\n•\nthe host detects a transport connection loss using methods outside the scope of this specification\n(e.g., the transport notifies the host of a loss of communication either with the controller to which\nthe command was submitted or with the queue on which the command was sent); or\n•\nthe host reads the Lost Host Communication log page (refer to section 5.2.12.3.2) via another\ncontroller in the same NVM subsystem and finds an entry containing the controller ID of that first\ncontroller and the value of the Controller Instance Uniquifier (CIU) field is the same as the value of\nthe CIU field in the Identify Controller data structure for that controller.\nAny action that terminates the NVMe Transport connection (e.g., a host reboot) causes the host to lose\ncommunication with a controller.\nA controller may detect a loss of communication at a different time (e.g., later) than the host detects that\nloss of communication. As explained in section 9.6.2.1, additional time may be required for the controller to\nstop processing commands after the controller detects a loss of communication.",
