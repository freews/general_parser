    "text": "The FDP Events log page is used to provide information about events affecting Reclaim Units and media\nusage in an Endurance Group that has Flexible Data Placement enabled. The log page is 4 KiB bytes in\nsize. The Endurance Group is specified by the Endurance Group Identifier in the Log Specific Identifier field\nas defined in Figure 221.\nFDP events are associated with Reclaim Unit Handles. An FDP event shall only be reported if the FDP\nevent occurs and that FDP event is enabled for that Reclaim Unit Handle (refer to section 5.2.26.1.21).\nIf:\n•\nan FDP event occurs;\n•\nthat event is enabled; and\n•\nthe number of events recorded is the maximum supported,\nthen the oldest event shall be discarded.\nThe FDP Event Type bit (refer to Figure 294) specifies whether the controller reports host events or\ncontroller events in the log page. The controller shall not report both host events and controller events in\nthe log page.\nIf Flexible Data Placement is enabled in the specified Endurance Group and a Get Log Page command\nspecifies this log page, then the NSID field in that command is reserved.\nIf Flexible Data Placement is disabled in the specified Endurance Group, then a Get Log Page command\nthat specifies this log page shall be aborted with a status code of FDP Disabled.\nThe FDP events shall be listed in ascending order of occurrence. Because the Timestamp feature may or\nmay not have been set by the host after each Controller Level Reset and because the Event Timestamp\nfield is the time at which the event was created, the FDP events may or may not be in order of ascending\nvalue of the Event Timestamp field.\nThe number of FDP events reported in the log page is equal to the value of the Number of FDP Events\nfield. The values of the bytes in this log page which follow the FDP Event List is implementation specific.\nThe format of the FDP event is described in Figure 296.\nIf the controller is not able to report the namespace identifier associated with the event, then the NSIDV bit\nshall be cleared to ‘0’.\nIf the controller is not able to report the specific Reclaim Unit Handle, then:\n•\nthe PIV bit shall be cleared to ‘0’; and\n•\nthe LV bit shall be cleared to ‘0’.",
