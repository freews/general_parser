    "text": "The Power Measurement log page (refer to Figure 297) is used for the reporting of logged interval power\nmeasurements for the Power Measurement capability, including:\n•\nthe average of the interval power measurements;\n•\nthe maximum interval power measurement; and\n•\na histogram of the interval power measurements.\nThe information in this log page shall be retained across power cycles and resets.\nThis log page is global to the NVM subsystem.\nRefer to section 8.1.19.1 for the usage of this log page by the host.\nThe Power Histogram Descriptor is defined in Figure 298. In this log page, the Power Histogram Descriptors\nshall be listed in ascending order based on the power indicated by the Power Histogram Bin Lower\nThreshold (PHBLT) field.\nIf:\n•\nthe Power Measurement Count (PMC) field is set to a non-zero value at the time this log page is\nread; and\n•\nthe Number of Power Histogram Descriptors Supported (NPHDS) field is set to a non-zero value,\nthen\n•\nthe first Power Histogram Descriptor (i.e., Power Histogram Descriptor 0) shall have the Power\nHistogram Bin Lower Threshold (PHBLT) field set to 0 Watts;\n•\nthe last Power Histogram Descriptor (i.e., Power Histogram Descriptor NPHD-1) shall contain the\nhighest power in the PHBLT field with a non-zero value in the Power Histogram Bin Count (PHBC)\nfield; and\n•\nthere shall be no gaps in the power ranges in the set of Power Histogram Descriptors returned (i.e.\nPower Histogram Descriptors with non-zero values in PHBC field are not packed together).\nIf the Power Measurement Count (PMC) field is cleared to 0h at the time this log page is read, then the\nNumber of Power Histogram Descriptors (NPHD) field shall be cleared to 0h.",
