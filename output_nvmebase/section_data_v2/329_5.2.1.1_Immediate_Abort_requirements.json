    "text": "If the controller performs an immediate abort, then the controller shall ensure that, other than the posting\nof the completion queue entry for the command to abort, there are no effects of that command (e.g., no\nhost memory access, command processing does not modify: NVM media, NVM Set state, Endurance\nGroup state, namespace state, controller state, domain state, or NVM subsystem state) subsequent to the\nposting of the CQE for the command that requested the abort. If the controller is not able to ensure there\nare no effects of the command to abort subsequent to the posting of the CQE for the command that\nrequested the abort, then the controller shall not perform an immediate abort on that command.\nFor example, if a command:\n•\nrequests a data transfer;\n•\nthe data transfer has been initiated and not completed; and\n•\nthe CQE for that command was not posted prior to the posting of the CQE for the command that\nrequested the abort,\nthen the controller is prohibited from performing an immediate abort.\nPerforming an immediate abort effects the information returned in the CQE for the command that requested\nthe abort as described in section 5.2.1.2 for an Abort command and in section 7.1.1 for a Cancel command.",
