    "text": "The Tracked Memory Changes management operation of the Track Receive command is used to report\nhost memory changes by the controller specified by the Controller Identifier (CNTLID) field (refer to Figure\n488) processing any and all commands (e.g., Admin commands, I/O command) as a result of tracking host\nmemory modifications being started by a Tracked Memory Changes management operation of the Track\nSend command (refer to section 5.2.28.1.2).\nThe data returned is a Tracked Memory Change data structure defined by Figure 489. The identifier for the\ncontroller that is tracked is specified in the Controller Identifier field in the Command Dword 11 field as\ndefined in Figure 488.\nIf the Track Receive command for this management operation completes successfully, then the controller\nshall remove the tracked memory changes that were reported in the returned data. The reported memory\nranges identify the host memory that has changed due to the specified controller processing commands\nsince:\n•\nTrack Memory Changes was enabled (refer to 5.2.28.1.2) and no tracked memory changes have\nbeen reported by the controller; or\n•\nthe controller last reported tracking change while the memory tracking remained enabled.\nIf tracked memory changes occur for the same memory address at a high frequency, the controller reporting\nof the Tracking Memory Changed Descriptors for that address may be delayed by a vendor specific amount\nof time so that Tracking Memory Changed Descriptors for other addresses are able to be reported during\nthat vendor specific amount of time.\nIf the Suspended bit is set to ‘1’ and the More To Report (MTR) bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the returned Track\nMemory Changed data structure, then all host memory changes have been reported to the host. If the\ncontroller specified by the CNTLID field remains suspended, then the controller has no more tracked host\nmemory changes to report to the host until the controller specified by the CNTLID field is resumed.\nIf the Suspended bit is cleared to ‘0’ and the More To Report (MTR) bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the returned Track\nMemory Changed data structure, then no additional tracked host memory changes are available to report\nto the host in a subsequent commands at the time of processing this command.\nFigure 492 defines a Tracked Memory Changed Descriptor.",
