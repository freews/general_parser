    "text": "The Doorbell Buffer Config command is used to provide two separate memory buffers that mirror the\ncontroller's doorbell properties defined in section 3.1.4. This command is intended for emulated controllers\nand is not typically supported by a physical NVMe controller. The two buffers are known as “Shadow\nDoorbell” and “EventIdx”, respectively. Refer to “Updating Controller Doorbell Properties using a Shadow\nDoorbell Buffer” in section B.5.2 for an example of how these buffers may be used.\nThe Doorbell Buffer Config command uses the PRP Entry 1 and PRP Entry 2 fields. All other command\nspecific fields are reserved. The command is not namespace specific, does not support metadata, and does\nnot support SGLs. The settings are not retained across a Controller Level Reset.\nEach buffer supplied with the Doorbell Buffer Config command shall be a single physical memory page as\ndefined by the CC.MPS field. The controller shall ensure that the following condition is satisfied:",
