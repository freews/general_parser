    "text": "The host may configure events to be triggered when thresholds do not exceed certain levels or when\nautonomous transitions occur using the Predictable Latency Mode Feature. The host submits a Set Feature\ncommand for the particular NVM Set and configures the specific event(s) and threshold(s) values that shall\ntrigger a Predictable Latency Event Aggregate Log Change Notice event for that particular NVM Set to the\nhost. Refer to Figure 423.\nThe host determines the NVM Sets that have outstanding events by reading the Predictable Latency Event\nAggregate log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.12). An entry is returned for each NVM Set that has an event\noutstanding. The host may use the NVM Set Identifier Maximum value reported in the Identify Controller\ndata structure in order to determine the maximum size of this log page.\nTo determine the specific event(s) that have occurred for a reported NVM Sets, the host reads the\nPredictable Latency Per NVM Set log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.11) for that NVM Set. The Event Type\nfield indicates the event(s) that have occurred (e.g., an autonomous transition to the NDWIN). An event(s)\nfor a particular NVM Set is cleared if the controller successfully processes a read for the Predictable Latency\nPer NVM Set log page for the affected NVM Set where the Get Log Page command has the Retain\nAsynchronous Event parameter cleared to ‘0’. If the Event Type field in the Predictable Latency Per NVM\nSet log page is cleared to 0h, then events for that particular NVM Set are not reported in the Predictable\nLatency Event Aggregate log page.",
