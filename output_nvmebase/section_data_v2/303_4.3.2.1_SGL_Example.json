    "text": "Figure 124 shows an example of a data read request using SGLs. In the example, the logical block size is\n512B. The total length of the logical blocks accessed is 13 KiB, of which only 11 KiB is transferred to the\nhost. The Number of Logical Blocks (NLB) field in the command shall specify 26, indicating the total length\nof the logical blocks accessed on the controller is 13 KiB. There are three SGL segments describing the\nlocations in memory where the logical block data is transferred.\nThe three SGL segments contain a total of three Data Block descriptors with lengths of 3 KiB, 4 KiB, and\n4 KiB respectively. Segment 1 of the Destination SGL contains a Bit Bucket descriptor with a length of 2 KiB\nthat specifies to not transfer (i.e., ignore) 2 KiB of logical block data from the NVM. Segment 1 of the\ndestination SGL also contains a Last Segment descriptor specifying that the segment pointed to by the\ndescriptor is the last SGL segment.",
