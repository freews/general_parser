    "text": "For some operations that specify multiple namespaces it is necessary to indicate what namespaces are\nable to be used in those operations (e.g., the Copy command in the NVM Command Set that specifies\nmultiple namespaces, the Execute command in the Computational Programs Command Set). This ability\nis called reachability. Reachability is defined at the controller level (i.e., only namespaces attached to the\nsame controller are reachable).\nI/O controllers that support the Computational Programs Command Set are required to support Reachability\nReporting. Reachability Reporting support is optional for I/O controllers that do not support the\nComputational Programs Command Set.\nA Reachability Group becomes available to a controller if:\na) a namespace becomes attached to that controller and that namespace is associated with a\nReachability Group that did not currently have any namespaces attached to that controller; or\nb) a configuration change in an NVM subsystem changes the membership in a Reachability Group\n(e.g., a new Reachability Group is present in the Reachability Groups log page (refer to section\n5.2.12.1.25)).\nA Reachability Group becomes unavailable to a controller if a namespace is detached that is the only\nnamespace attached to that controller for that Reachability Group (i.e., a Reachability Group that was\npresent in the Reachability Groups log page is no longer present).\nA Reachability Association change occurs if a Reachability Group that is associated with that Reachability\nAssociation becomes available or unavailable to that controller. (e.g., a new Reachability Association is\npresent in the Reachability Associations log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.26) or a Reachability Association\nthat was present in the Reachability Associations log page is no longer present).\nIf an NVM subsystem supports Reachability Reporting, then all controllers in that NVM subsystem shall:\n•\nset the RRSUP bit to ‘1’ in the Controller Reachability Capabilities (CRCAP) field in the Identify\nController data structure (refer to Figure 328) to indicate support for Reachability Reporting;\n•\nsupport Reachability Groups Change Notices (refer to section 5.2.26.1.5);\n•\nsupport Reachability Association Change Notices (refer to section 5.2.26.1.5);\n•\nsupport the Reachability Groups log page; and\n•\nsupport the Reachability Associations log page.\nNamespaces attached to a controller in an NVM subsystem that supports Reachability Reporting shall:\n•\nbe members of a Reachability Group; and\n•\nsupply a valid Reachability Group Identifier in the Reachability Group Identifier (RGRPID) field in\nthe I/O Command Set Independent Identify Namespace Data Structure (refer to Figure 335).\nReachability and characteristics of reachability are indicated in the combination of the Reachability Groups\nlog page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.25) and the Reachability Associations log page (refer to section\n5.2.12.1.26). A Reachability Group defines a group of namespaces that are all associated with namespaces\nin other Reachability Groups defined by a Reachability Association. The method of assigning Reachability\nGroup identifiers and Reachability Association identifiers is outside the scope of this specification. If\nmembers of a Reachability Group are able to reach members of that Reachability Group, then a\nReachability Association that contains only that Reachability Group specifies the characteristics of that\nreachability. All Reachability Groups in a Reachability Association have identical access characteristics. All\nnamespaces in a Reachability Group have identical access characteristics. If a Reachability Group is not\nin any Reachability Association then the members of that Reachability Group are not reachable by any\nother namespaces, including the members of that Reachability Group. A namespace is always able to reach\nitself (i.e., a command that has two or more NSIDs as part of the command where those NSIDs are all the\nsame is not constrained by reachability).\nIf the Reachability Association Characteristics field (refer to Figure 283) is set to is 01h, then all namespaces\nin the associated Reachability Groups are able to reach other namespaces in the other Reachability Groups\nin that Reachability Association without any indication of a performance characteristic (e.g., for the Execute\ncommand in the Computational Programs Command Set). If the Reachability Association Characteristics\nfield is set to 02h, then all namespaces in the associated Reachability Groups are reachable and support\nfast copy operations as defined by the applicable NVM Express I/O Command Set specification (e.g., the\nFast copy operations section in the NVM Express NVM Command Set Specification). If the Reachability\nAssociation Characteristics field is set to 03h, then all namespaces in the associated Reachability Groups\nare reachable but do not support fast copy operations.\nA namespace is only allowed to be in one Reachability Group. A Reachability Group is in zero or more\nReachability Associations with different values of the Reachability Association Characteristics field for each\nReachability Association.\nThe Reachability Group Identifier (RGRPID) for each Reachability Group shall be unique within the NVM\nsubsystem. If RGIDC bit in the CRCAP field in the Identify Controller data structure is set to ‘1’, then the\nReachability Group Identifier shall not change while the namespace is attached to any controller in the NVM\nsubsystem. If RGIDC bit in the CRCAP field is cleared to ‘0’, then the Reachability Group Identifier may\nchange while the namespace is attached to any controller in the NVM subsystem. If the Reachability Group\nIdentifier changes, the controller shall issue the Reachability Groups Change Notice as described in this\nsection.\nFigure 688 is an example configuration that shows that:\n•\nReachability Association 1 (i.e., RA 1):\nspecifies that:\nNVM Express® Base Specification, Revision 2.3\n▪\nNSID 10 and NSID 30 are able to reach each other; and\n▪\nNSID 10 and NSID 31 are able to reach each other;\nand\ndoes not specify any reachability between NSID 30 and NSID 31;\n•\nReachability Association 2 (i.e., RA 2) is a self-reference for Reachability Group A (i.e., RG A) that\nspecifies:\nthat NSID 30 and NSID 31 are able to reach each other;\n•\nReachability Association 3 (i.e., RA 3):\nspecifies that:\n▪\nNSID 11 and NSID 30 are able to reach each other; and\n▪\nNSID 11 and NSID 31 are able to reach each other;\nand\ndoes not specify any reachability between NSID 30 and N\n•\nThe lack of a Reachability Association that contains Reachability Group B (i.e., RG B) and\nReachability Group D (i.e., RG D) specifies:\nthat NSID 10 and NSID 11 are not able to reach each other;\nand\n•\nThe lack of a self-referencing Reachability Association for Reachability Group E (i.e., RG E)\nspecifies:\nthat NSID 22 and NSID 23 are not able to reach each other.",
