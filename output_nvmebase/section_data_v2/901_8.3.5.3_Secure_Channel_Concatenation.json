    "text": "It is possible to leverage an authentication transaction to generate shared key material to use as pre-shared\nkey (PSK) to establish a secure channel (e.g., with IPsec or TLS). This PSK is generated by an\nauthentication transaction on an Admin Queue over an unsecure channel. Once the authentication\ntransaction is completed, that Admin Queue transport connection shall be disconnected by the host. The\ngenerated PSK may then be used to set up secure channels for subsequent Admin Queue(s) and I/O\nQueues.\nThe process of generating a PSK on an Admin Queue over an insecure channel, disconnecting that Admin\nQueue transport connection, and setting up an Admin Queue over a secure channel established using that\ngenerated PSK is called secure channel concatenation. Figure 788 shows an example of this process for\nTLS with NVMe/TCP, where steps 1 to 7 show TLS secure channel concatenation for the Admin Queue\nand steps 8 to 13 show the setup of TLS secure channels for the I/O Queues.\nSecure channel concatenation is prohibited over any secure channel that has been established in\ncompliance with the requirements of an NVM Express Transport specification (e.g., the NVMe over TCP\nTransport Specification). The controller response to a host that requests secure channel concatenation in\nthis situation is specified in section 8.3.5.4.1. In contrast, replacing a PSK for such a secure channel is\npermitted (refer to section 8.3.5.4.1.",
