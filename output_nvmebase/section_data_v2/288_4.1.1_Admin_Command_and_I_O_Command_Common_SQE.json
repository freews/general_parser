PRPs shall be used for all Admin commands for NVMe over PCIe implementations. SGLs shall be used for all Admin and I/O commands for NVMe over Fabrics implementations (i.e., this field set to 01b). An NVMe Transport may support only specific values (refer to the applicable NVMe Transport binding specification for details).<br> |\n| | | **Value** | **Definition** |\n| | | 00b | PRPs Used: PRPs are used for this transfer. |\n| | | 01b | SGLs Used MPTR Address: SGLs are used for this transfer. If used, Metadata Pointer (MPTR) contains an address of a single contiguous physical buffer.<br>Refer to the Metadata Buffer Alignment (MBA) bit of the SGLS field in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328) for alignment requirements. |\n| | | 10b | SGLs Used MPTR SGL Segment: SGLs are used for this transfer. If used, Metadata Pointer (MPTR) contains an address of an SGL segment containing exactly one SGL Descriptor that is qword aligned. |\n| | | 11b | Reserved |\n| | | If there is metadata that is not interleaved with the user data, as specified in the Format NVM command, then the Metadata Pointer (MPTR) field is used to point to the metadata.

If the namespace identifier is not used for the command, then this field shall be cleared to 0h. The value FFFFFFFFh in this field is a broadcast value (refer to section 3.2.1.2), where the scope (e.g., the NVM subsystem, all attached namespaces, or all namespaces in the NVM subsystem) are dependent on the command. Refer to Figure 142 and Figure 589 for commands that support the use of the value FFFFFFFFh in this field. |\n| | Specifying an inactive namespace identifier (refer to section 3.2.1.4) in a command that uses the namespace identifier shall cause the controller to abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command, unless otherwise specified. Specifying an invalid namespace identifier (refer to section 3.2.1.2) in a command that uses the namespace identifier shall cause the controller to abort the command with a status code of Invalid Namespace or Format, unless otherwise specified. |\n| | If the namespace identifier is used for the command (refer to Figure 142), the value FFFFFFFFh is not supported for that command, and the host specifies a value of FFFFFFFFh, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command, unless otherwise specified. |\n| | If the namespace identifier is not used for the command and the host specifies a value from 1h to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command, unless otherwise specified. |\n| 07:04 | **Command Dword 1 (CDW1):** This field is command specific. |\n| 11:08 | **Command Dword 2 (CDW2):** This field is command specific Dword2. |\n| 15:12 | **Command Dword 3 (CDW3):** This field is command specific Dword3. |\n| Bytes | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 23:16 | **Metadata Pointer (MPTR):** If CDW0.PSDT (refer to Figure 91) is cleared to 00b, then this field shall contain the address of a contiguous physical buffer of metadata and that address shall be dword aligned (i.e., bits 1:0 cleared to 00b). The controller is not required to check that bits 1:0 are cleared to 00b. The controller may report an error of Invalid Field in Command if bits 1:0 are not cleared to 00b. If the controller does not report an error of Invalid Field in Command, then the controller shall operate as if bits 1:0 are cleared to 00b. |\n| | If CDW0.PSDT is set to 01b, then this field shall contain the address of a contiguous physical buffer of metadata. Refer to the Metadata Buffer Alignment (MBA) bit of the SGLS field in the Identify Controller data structure for alignment requirements. |\n| | If CDW0.PSDT is set to 10b, then this field shall contain the address of an SGL segment that contains exactly one SGL Descriptor. The address of that SGL segment shall be qword aligned (i.e., bits 2:0 cleared to 000b). The SGL Descriptor contained in that SGL segment is the first SGL Descriptor of the metadata for the command. If the SGL Descriptor contained in that SGL segment is an SGL Data Block descriptor, then that SGL Data Block Descriptor is the only SGL Descriptor and therefore describes the entire metadata data transfer. Refer to section 4.3.2. The controller is not required to check that bits 2:0 are not cleared to 000b. The controller may report an error of Invalid Field in Command if bits 2:0 are not cleared to 000b. If the controller does not report an error of Invalid Field in Command, then the controller shall operate as if bits 2:0 are cleared to 000b. |\n| Bytes | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 39:32 | **Data Pointer (DPTR):** This field specifies the data used in the command. |\n| | If CDW0.PSDT is cleared to 00b, then the definition of this field is: |\n| | **PRP Entry 2 (PRP2):** This field: |\n| | • is reserved if the data transfer does not cross a memory page boundary; |\n| | • specifies the Page Base Address of the second memory page if the data transfer crosses exactly one memory page boundary. E.g., |\n| | o the command data transfer length is equal in size to one memory page and the offset portion of the PBAO field of PRP1 is non-zero; or |\n| | o the Offset portion of the PBAO field of PRP1 is equal to 0h and the command data transfer length is greater than one memory page and less than or equal to two memory pages in size; |\n| | and |\n| | • is a PRP List pointer if the data transfer crosses more than one memory page boundary. E.g.,: |\n| | o the command data transfer length is greater than or equal to two memory pages in size but the offset portion of the PBAO field of PRP1 is non-zero; or |\n| | o the command data transfer length is equal in size to more than two memory pages and the Offset portion of the PBAO field of PRP1 is equal to 0h. |\n| | **PRP Entry 1 (PRP1):** This field contains: |\n| | • the first PRP entry for the command; or |\n| | • a PRP List pointer, |\n| | depending on the command (e.g., the Create I/O Completion Queue command (refer to Figure 502)). |\n| | If CDW0.PSDT is set to 01b or 10b, then the definition of this field is: |\n| | **SGL Entry 1 (SGL1):** This field contains the first SGL segment for the command. |\n| | If the SGL segment is an SGL Data Block or Keyed SGL Data Block or Transport SGL Data Block descriptor, then it describes the entire data transfer. If more than one SGL segment is needed to describe the data transfer, then the first SGL segment is a Segment, or Last Segment descriptor. Refer to section 4.3.2 for the definition of SGL segments and descriptor types. |\n| | The NVMe Transport may support a subset of SGL Descriptor types and features as defined in the NVMe Transport binding specification. |\n| 39:24 | |\n| 43:40 | **Command Dword 10 (CDW10):** This field is command specific Dword 10. |\n| 47:44 | **Command Dword 11 (CDW11):** This field is command specific Dword 11. |\n| 51:48 | **Command Dword 12 (CDW12):** This field is command specific Dword 12. |\n| 55:52 | **Command Dword 13 (CDW13):** This field is command specific Dword 13. |\n| 59:56 | **Command Dword 14 (CDW14):** This field is command specific Dword 14. |\n| 63:60 | **Command Dword 15 (CDW15):** This field is command specific Dword 15. |"
