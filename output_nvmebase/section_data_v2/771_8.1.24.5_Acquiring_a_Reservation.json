    "text": "In order for a host to obtain a reservation on a namespace, that host shall be a registrant of that namespace.\nA registrant obtains a reservation by executing a Reservation Acquire command (refer to section 7.5),\nclearing the Reservation Acquire Action (RACQA) field to 000b (Acquire), and supplying the current\nreservation key associated with the host in the Current Reservation Key (CRKEY) field. The CRKEY value\nshall match that used by the registrant to register with the namespace. If the CRKEY value does not match,\nthen the command is aborted with a status code of Reservation Conflict. If the host is not a registrant, then\nthe command is aborted with a status code of Reservation Conflict.\nOnly one reservation is allowed at a time on a namespace. If a registrant attempts to obtain a reservation\non a namespace that already has a reservation holder, then the command is aborted with a status code of\nReservation Conflict. If a reservation holder attempts to obtain a reservation of a different type on a\nnamespace for which that host already is the reservation holder, then the command is aborted with a status\ncode of Reservation Conflict. If a reservation holder attempts to obtain a reservation of the same type on a\nnamespace for which that host already is the reservation holder, then it is not a Reservation Conflict and\nthe command is processed. A reservation holder may preempt a reservation to change the reservation type.",
