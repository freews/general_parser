The command for which this status is returned may be retried\non a different controller in the same NVM subsystem if more than one controller is available to the host.\nIn a multipath environment, unless otherwise specified, errors of this type should be retried using a different\npath, if one is available.",

Retries for the request function should be based on the setting of the DNR bit (refer to Figure 100). |\n| 01h | **Asymmetric Access Persistent Loss:** The requested function (e.g., command) is not able to be performed as a result of the relationship between the controller and the namespace, NVM Set, or Endurance Group being in the ANA Persistent Loss state (refer to section 8.1.1.6). The command should not be re-submitted to the same controller. |\n| 02h | **Asymmetric Access Inaccessible:** The requested function (e.g., command) is not able to be performed as a result of the relationship between the controller and the namespace, NVM Set, or Endurance Group being in the ANA Inaccessible state (refer to section 8.1.1.6). The command should not be re-submitted to the same controller. |\n| 03h | **Asymmetric Access Transition:** The requested function (e.g., command) is not able to be performed as a result of the relationship between the controller and the namespace, NVM Set, or Endurance Group transitioning between Asymmetric Namespace Access states (refer to section 8.1.1.7). The requested function should be retried after the transition is complete. |\n| 04h to 5Fh | Reserved |\n| | **Controller detected Pathing errors** |\n| 60h | **Controller Pathing Error:** A pathing error was detected by the controller. |\n| 61h to 6Fh | Reserved |\n| | **Host detected Pathing errors** |\n| 70h | **Host Pathing Error:** A pathing error was detected by the host. |\n| 71h | **Command Aborted By Host:** The command was aborted as a result of host action (e.g., the host disconnected the fabric connection). |\n| 72h to 7Fh | Reserved |\n| | **Other Pathing errors** |\n| 80h to BFh | I/O Command Set Specific |\n| C0h to FFh | Vendor Specific |"
