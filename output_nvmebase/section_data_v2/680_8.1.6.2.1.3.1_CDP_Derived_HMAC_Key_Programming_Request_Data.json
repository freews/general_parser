This field shall be set to the CDP Response Data Frame common fields with the CDP Request Message Type field set to a value of value of 3h (i.e. Derived HMAC Key Programming Request). |\n| 06 | CDP Authentication Algorithm (CDPAA): This field specifies the keyed-hash algorithm being used <br> This field contains the value that represents the position of the corresponding bit in the CDPALG bitmask (e.g., a value of '0h' corresponds to the HMAC-SHA-384 algorithm) |\n| 07 | Host Programmed Key Size (HPKS): This field specifies the size in bytes of the host-programmed key in the HPK field. <br> The size of the host-programmed key is dependent on the CDP Authentication Algorithm used (refer to Figure 642). |\n| (HPKS+7):08 | Host Programmed Key (HPK): This field specifies the value of the host-programmed key. The value of this field is the host-programmed key used by the controller to calculate the DHK. |"
