The settings are specified\nin Command Dword 11.\nBy default, coalescing settings are enabled for each interrupt vector. Interrupt coalescing is not supported\nfor the Admin Completion Queue.\nIf a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure 475 are returned\nin Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command for the Interrupt Vector specified in Command\nDword 11.\nPrior to issuing a Set Features command that specifies this Feature, the host shall configure the specified\nInterrupt Vector with an I/O Completion Queue (refer to section 5.3.1). If the specified Interrupt Vector is\ninvalid, or not associated with an existing I/O Completion Queue (refer to Figure 504), then the controller\nshould abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.",
