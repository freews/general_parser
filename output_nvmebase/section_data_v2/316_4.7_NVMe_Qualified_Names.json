    "text": "NVMe Qualified Names (NQNs) are used to uniquely describe a host or NVM subsystem for the purposes\nof identification and authentication. The NVMe Qualified Name for the NVM subsystem is specified in the\nIdentify Controller data structure. An NQN is permanent for the lifetime of the host or NVM subsystem.\nAn NVMe Qualified Name is encoded as a UTF-8 string of Unicode characters (refer to section 1.4.2) with\nthe following properties:\n•\nThe encoding is UTF-8 (refer to RFC 3629);\n•\nThe following characters are used in formatting:\no\ndash (‘-‘=U+002d);\no\ndot (‘.’=U+002e); and\no\ncolon (‘:’=U+003a);\n•\nThe maximum name is 223 bytes in length; and\n•\nThe string is null terminated.\nThere are two supported NQN formats. The first format may be used by any organization that owns a\ndomain name. This naming format may be used to create a human interpretable string to describe the host\nor NVM subsystem. This format consists of:\n•\nThe string “nqn”;\n•\nThe string “.” (i.e., the ASCII period character);\n•\nA date code, in “yyyy-mm” format. This date shall be during a time interval when the naming\nauthority owned the domain name used in this format. The date code uses the Gregorian calendar.\nAll digits and the dash shall be included;\n•\nThe string “.” (i.e., the ASCII period character);\n•\nThe reverse domain name of the naming authority that is creating the NQN; and\n•\nA colon (:) prefixed string that the owner of the domain name assigns that does not exceed the\nmaximum length. The naming authority is responsible to ensure that the NQN is worldwide unique.\nThe reverse domain name in an NQN that uses this format shall not be “org.nvmexpress”.\nThe following are examples of NVMe Qualified Names that may be generated by “Example NVMe, Inc.”\n•\nThe string “nqn.2014-08.com.example:nvme:nvm-subsystem-sn-d78432”; and\n•\nThe string “nqn.2014-08.com.example:nvme.host.sys.xyz”.\nThe second format may be used to create a unique identifier when there is not a naming authority or there\nis not a requirement for a human interpretable string. This format consists of:\n•\nThe string “nqn”;\n•\nThe string “.” (i.e., the ASCII period character);\n•\nThe string “2014-08.org.nvmexpress:uuid:”; and\n•\nA 128-bit UUID based on the definition in RFC 9562 represented as a string formatted as\n“11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555”.\nThe following is an example of an NVMe Qualified Name using the UUID-based format:\n•\nThe string “nqn.2014-08.org.nvmexpress:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6”.\nNVMe hosts, controllers and NVM subsystems process (e.g., compare for equality) UTF-8 NVMe Qualified\nNames without any text processing or text comparison logic that is specific to the Unicode character set or\nlocale (refer to section 4.8).",
