A host may check the current\nnamespace write protection state of a namespace using the Get Features command with the Namespace\nWrite Protection Config Feature Identifier.\nIf any controller in the NVM subsystem supports Namespace Write Protection, then the write protection\nstate of a namespace shall be enforced by any controller to which that namespace is attached.",
