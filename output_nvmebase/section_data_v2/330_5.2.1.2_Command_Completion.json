Dword 0 of the completion queue entry\nindicates information about the command to abort as shown in Figure 147.\nIf the Immediate Abort Not Performed bit in Dword 0 (refer to Figure 147) is set to ‘1’ in the completion\nqueue entry for the Abort command and a deferred abort is performed, then the controller shall set the\nstatus code for the command to abort to Command Abort Requested. The host should examine the status\nin the completion queue entry of the command to abort to determine if the command was aborted.\nCommand specific status code values associated with the Abort command are defined in Figure 148.",
