The Power-on or Reset Event reports\ninformation about resets due to power-on or other events that cause resets (refer to section 3.7) followed\nby descriptors reporting information about the controller at the time the reset occurred, including timestamp\nvalues for all controllers for use in synchronization of timestamp values across controllers.\nThe controller shall set the Persistent Event Log Event Header:\n•\nEvent Type field to 04h; and\n•\nEvent Type Revision field to 01h.\nThe Power-on or Reset Event data is specified in Figure 237.",
