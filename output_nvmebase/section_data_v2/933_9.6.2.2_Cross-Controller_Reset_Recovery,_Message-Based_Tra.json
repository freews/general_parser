    "text": "This section describes Cross-Controller Reset Recovery, which is specific to the Message-based transport\nmodel.\nCross-Controller Reset Recovery (refer to section 8.3.3) enables a host to recover from a loss of\ncommunication with one controller, the Impacted Controller, via another controller, the Source Controller,\nin the same NVM subsystem, selected using guidelines in section 5.4.3. For Cross-Controller Reset\nRecovery, the host performs the following steps:\n1. Initiate termination of the association and the associated transport connections with the Impacted\nController.\n2. Submit a Cross-Controller Reset command (refer to section 5.4.3) to the Source Controller\nspecifying the Impacted Controller\nspecifying the Impacted Controller.\n3.\nDetermine that the Cross-Controller Reset operation has completed by:\na. receiving a CQE for the Cross-Controller Reset command with the Immediate Reset\nSuccessful (IRS) bit set to ‘1’; or\nb. reading the Cross-Controller Reset log page (refer to section 5.2.12.3.1). The associated\nentry indicates the operation is complete by reporting a value that is not In Progress in the\nCross-Controller Reset Status (CCRS) field. The host may read that log page in response\nto a Cross-Controller Reset Completed asynchronous event or the host may poll the Cross-\nController Reset log page to monitor the associated entry.\nIf the Cross-Controller Reset operation succeeds, the host is able to proceed with recovery of outstanding\ncommands sent to the instance of the Impacted Controller specified in the CIU field, CIRNL field and CIRNU\nfield in the Cross-Controller Reset command. The host does not need to wait for completion of the\nassociation termination that the host initiated in step 1 before proceeding with recovery of outstanding\ncommands.\nIf the Cross-Controller Reset operation fails (i.e., the value of the CCRS field is Failed) in the associated\nentry in the Cross-Controller Reset log page, the host should decide whether to retry Cross-Controller Reset\nRecovery as described in section 8.3.3. If all host attempts of Cross-Controller Reset Recovery fail, then\nthe host should use Time-Based Recovery (refer to section 9.6.2.1).",
