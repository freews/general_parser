    "text": "This log page is used to provide SMART and general health information. The information provided is over\nthe life of the controller and is retained across power cycles unless otherwise specified. To request the\ncontroller log page, the namespace identifier specified is FFFFFFFFh or 0h. For compatibility with\nimplementations compliant with NVM Express Base Specification, Revision 1.4 and earlier, hosts should\nuse a namespace identifier of FFFFFFFFh to request the controller log page. The controller may also\nsupport requesting the log page on a per namespace basis, as indicated by the SMART Support bit of the\nLPA field in the Identify Controller data structure in Figure 328.\nIf the log page is not supported on a per namespace basis and:\n•\nif a namespace identifier other than 0h or FFFFFFFFh is specified by the host, then the controller\nshall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command; and\n•\nif a namespace identifier of 0h or FFFFFFFFh is specified by the host, then the controller returns\nthe controller log page.\nThere is no namespace specific information defined in the SMART / Health Information log page in this\nrevision of the specification, thus the controller log page and namespaces specific log page contain identical\ninformation.\nCritical warnings regarding the health of the NVM subsystem may be indicated via an asynchronous event\nnotification to the host. The warnings that result in an asynchronous event notification to the host are\nconfigured using the Set Features command; refer to section 5.2.26.1.5.\nPerformance may be calculated using parameters returned as part of the SMART / Health Information log.\nSpecifically, the number of Read or Write commands, the amount of data read or written, and the amount\nof controller busy time enables both I/Os per second and bandwidth to be calculated.\nThe log page returned is defined in Figure 210.",

        "table_md": "| Bytes | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| | **Critical Warning (CW):** This field indicates critical warnings for the state of the controller. Each bit corresponds to a critical warning type; multiple bits may be set to '1'. If a bit is cleared to '0', then that critical warning does not apply. Critical warnings may result in an asynchronous event notification to the host. Bits in this field represent the state at the time the Get Log Page command is processed and may not reflect the state at the time a related asynchronous event notification, if any, occurs or occurred. |\n| | **Bits** |\n| | **Description** |\n| 00 | 7: Reserved |\n| | 6: Indeterminate Personality State (IPS): If this bit is set to '1', then a requested change to the settings of a personality did not complete successfully and the controller was not able to revert to the previous personality. As a result, the settings of a personality in the NVM subsystem are in an indeterminate state (refer to section 8.1.6.1). |\n| | 5: Persistent Memory Region Read-Only (PMRRO): If this bit is set to '1', then the NVM subsystem reliability has become read-only or unreliable (refer to section 8.2.4). |\n| | 4: Volatile Memory Backup Failed (VMBF): If this bit is set to '1', then the volatile memory backup device has failed. This field is only valid if the controller has a volatile memory backup solution. |\n| | 3: All Media Read-Only (AMRO): If this bit is set to '1', then all of the media has been placed in read only mode. The controller shall not set this bit to '1' if the read-only condition on the media is a result of a change in the write protection state of a namespace (refer to section 8.1.17.1). |\n| | 2: NVM Subsystem Degraded Reliability (NDR): If this bit is set to '1', then the NVM subsystem reliability has been degraded due to significant media related errors or any internal error that degrades NVM subsystem reliability. |\n| | 1: Temperature Threshold Condition (TTC): If this bit is set to '1', then a temperature is: <br> a) greater than or equal to an over temperature threshold; or <br> b) less than or equal to an under temperature threshold, <br> (refer to section 5.2.26.1.3). |\n| | 0: Available Spare Capacity Below Threshold (ASCBT): If this bit is set to '1', then the available spare capacity has fallen below the threshold. |\n| 02:01 | **Composite Temperature (CTEMP):** Contains a value corresponding to a temperature in Kelvins that represents the current composite temperature of the controller and namespace(s) associated with that controller. The manner in which this value is computed is implementation specific and may not represent the actual temperature of any physical point in the NVM subsystem. The value of this field may be used to trigger an asynchronous event (refer to section 5.2.26.1.3). <br> Warning and critical overheating composite temperature threshold values are reported by the WCTEMP and CCTEMP fields in the Identify Controller data structure in Figure 328. |\n| 03 | **Available Spare (AVSP):** Contains a normalized percentage (0% to 100%) of the remaining spare capacity available. |\n| 04 | **Available Spare Threshold (AVSPT):** When the Available Spare falls below the threshold indicated in this field, an asynchronous event completion may occur. The value is indicated as a normalized percentage (0% to 100%). The values 101 to 255 are reserved. |\n| Bytes | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 05 | **Percentage Used (PUSED):** Contains a vendor specific estimate of the percentage of NVM subsystem life used based on the actual usage and the manufacturer's prediction of NVM life. A value of 100 indicates that the estimated endurance of the NVM in the NVM subsystem has been consumed but may not indicate an NVM subsystem failure. The value is allowed to exceed 100. Percentage greater than 254 shall not be represented as 255. This value shall be updated once per power-on hour (when the controller is not in a sleep state). <br> Refer to the JEDEC JESD218B-02 standard for SSD device life and endurance measurement techniques. |\n| 06 | **Endurance Group Critical Warning Summary (EGCWS):** This field indicates critical warnings for the state of Endurance Groups. Each bit corresponds to a critical warning type, multiple bits may be set to '1'. If a bit is cleared to '0', then that critical warning does not apply to any Endurance Group. Critical warnings may result in an asynchronous event notification to the host. Bits in this field represent the current associated state and are not persistent. <br> If a bit is set to '1' in one or more Endurance Groups, then the corresponding bit shall be set to '1' in this field. |\n| | **Bits** |\n| | **Description** |\n| | 7:4: Reserved |\n| | 3: Endurance Group Read-Only (EGRO): If this bit is set to '1', then the namespaces in one or more Endurance Groups have been placed in read only mode as a result of a change in the write protection state of a namespace (refer to section 8.1.17.1). |\n| | 2: Endurance Group Degraded Reliability (EGDR): If this bit is set to '1', then the reliability of one or more Endurance Groups has been degraded due to significant media related errors or any internal error that degrades NVM subsystem reliability. |\n| | 1: Reserved |\n| | 0: Endurance Group Available Spare Capacity Below Threshold (EGASCBT): If this bit is set to '1', then the available spare capacity of one or more Endurance Groups has fallen below the threshold. |\n| 31:07 | Reserved |\n| 47:32 | **Data Units Read (DUR):** Contains the number of 512 byte data units the host has read from the controller as part of processing a SMART Data Units Read Command; this value does not include metadata. This value is reported in thousands (i.e., a value of 1 corresponds to 1,000 units of 512 bytes read) and is rounded up (e.g., one indicates that the number of 512 byte data units read is from 1,000 to 1,000, three indicates that the number of 512 byte data units read is from 2,001 to 3,000). <br> Refer to the applicable NVM Express I/O Command Set specification for the list of SMART Data Units Read Commands that affect this field. |\n| 63:48 | **Data Units Written (DUW):** Contains the number of 512 byte data units the host has written to the controller as part of processing a User Data Out Command; this value does not include metadata. This value is reported in thousands (i.e., a value of 1 corresponds to 1,000 units of 512 bytes written) and is rounded up (e.g., one indicates that the number of 512 byte data units written is from 1 to 1,000, three indicates that the number of 512 byte data units written is from 2,001 to 3,000). <br> Refer to the applicable NVM Express I/O Command Set specification for the list of User Data Out Commands that affect this field. |\n| 79:64 | **Host Read Commands (HRC):** Contains the number of SMART Host Read Commands completed by the controller. <br> Refer to the applicable NVM Express I/O Command Set specification for the list of SMART Host Read Commands that affect this field. |\n| 95:80 | **Host Write Commands (HWC):** Contains the number of User Data Out Commands completed by the controller. <br> Refer to the applicable NVM Express I/O Command Set specification for the list of User Data Out Commands that affect this field. |\n| Bytes | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 111:96 | **Controller Busy Time (CBT):** Contains the amount of time the controller is busy with I/O commands. The controller is busy when there is a command outstanding to an I/O Queue (specifically, a command was issued via an I/O Submission Queue Tail doorbell write and the corresponding completion queue entry has not been posted yet to the associated I/O Completion Queue). This value is reported in minutes. |\n| 112:117 | **Power Cycles (PWC):** Contains the number of power cycles. |\n| 118:128 | **Power On Hours (POH):** Contains the number of power-on hours. This may not include time that the controller was powered and in a non-operational power state. |\n| 175:160 | **Unexpected Power Losses (UPL):** Contains a count of the number of unexpected power losses. This count shall be incremented if, and only if, main power is lost when: <br> a) the controller does not report it is ready to be powered off (i.e., the CSTS.SHST field is not set to 10b); or <br> b) media is not in the shutdown state (refer to Figure 85) because an Admin command that accesses media as defined by Figure 84 was processed via the out-of-band mechanism with the Ignore Shutdown bit set to '1' (refer to the NVM Express Management Interface Specification) while shutdown processing was reported as in progress or was complete (i.e., the CSTS.SHST field was set to 01b or set to 10b). <br> Note that this field was previously named Unsafe Shutdowns. <br> If power is lost when the CSTS.SHST field is not set to 10b, then subsequent controller initialization (i.e., the amount of time from when the CC.EN bit transitions from '0' to '1' until the CSTS.RDY bit transitions from '0' to '1') may take longer for any NVM subsystem, and data corruption may occur for any NVM subsystem that is not protected against power loss. |\n| 175:160 | **Media and Data Integrity Errors (MDE):** Contains the number of occurrences where the controller detected an uncorrected data integrity error. Errors such as uncorrectable ECC, CRC checksum failure, or LBA tag mismatch are included in this field. Errors introduced as a result of a Write Uncorrectable command (refer to the NVM Express NVM Command Set Specification) may or may not be included in this field. |\n| 191:176 | **Number of Error Information Log Entries over the life of the controller. (NEILE):** Contains the number of Error Information Log Entries over the life of the controller. |\n| 195:192 | **Warning Composite Temperature Hysteresis Time (WCTH):** If the Temperature Threshold Hysteresis Attributes (TMPTH) field cleared to 0h (refer to Figure 328), then this field contains the amount of time in minutes that the controller is operational and the Composite Temperature is greater than or equal to the Warning Composite Temperature Threshold (WCTEMP) field and less than the Critical Composite Temperature Threshold (CTEMP) field in the Identify Controller data structure in Figure 328. <br> If the Temperature Threshold Maximum Hysteresis (TMPTHMH) and Temperature Threshold Hysteresis (TMPTH) fields are non-zero, then hysteresis time is included in the time specified in this field (refer to section 5.2.26.1.3.1). <br> If the value of the WCTEMP or CTEMP field is 0h, then this field is always cleared to 0h regardless of the Composite Temperature value. |\n| 199:196 | **Critical Composite Temperature Time (CCTT):** Contains the amount of time in minutes that the controller is operational and the Composite Temperature is greater than or equal to the Critical Composite Temperature Threshold (CTEMP) field in the Identify Controller data structure in Figure 328. <br> If the value of the CTEMP field is 0h, then this field is always cleared to 0h regardless of the Composite Temperature value. |\n| 201:200 | **Temperature Sensor 1 (TSEN1):** Contains the current temperature reported by temperature sensor 1. This field is defined by Figure 211. |\n| 203:202 | **Temperature Sensor 2 (TSEN2):** Contains the current temperature reported by temperature sensor 2.

This field is defined by Figure 211. |\n| 215:214 | **Temperature Sensor 8 (TSEN8):** Contains the current temperature reported by temperature sensor 8. This field is defined by Figure 211. |\n| 219:216 | **Thermal Management Temperature 1 Transition Count (TMT1TC):** Contains the number of times the controller transitioned to lower power active power states or performed vendor specific thermal management actions while minimizing the impact on performance in order to attempt to reduce the Composite Temperature above the Thermal Management Temperature 1. This counter shall not wrap once the value FFFFFFFFh is reached. A value of 0h, indicates that this transition has never occurred or this field is not implemented. |\n| 223:220 | **Thermal Management Temperature 2 Transition Count (TMT2TC):** Contains the number of times the controller transitioned to lower power active power states or performed vendor specific thermal management actions regardless of the impact on performance (e.g., heavy throttling) in order to attempt to reduce the Composite Temperature because of the host controlled thermal management feature (refer to section 8.1.18.5) (i.e., the Composite Temperature rose above the Thermal Management Temperature 2). This counter shall not wrap once the value FFFFFFFFh is reached. A value of 0h, indicates that this transition has never occurred or this field is not implemented. |\n| 227:224 | **Total Time for Thermal Management Temperature 1 (TTTMT1):** Contains the number of seconds that the controller had transitioned to lower power active power states or performed vendor specific thermal management actions regardless of the impact on performance (e.g., heavy throttling) in order to attempt to reduce the Composite Temperature because of the host controlled thermal management feature (refer to section 8.1.18.5). This counter shall not wrap once the value FFFFFFFFh is reached. A value of 0h, indicates that this transition has never occurred or this field is not implemented. |\n| 231:228 | **Total Time for Thermal Management Temperature 2 (TTTMT2):** Contains the number of seconds that the controller had transitioned to lower power active power states or performed vendor specific thermal management actions while minimizing the impact on performance in order to attempt to reduce the Composite Temperature because of the host controlled thermal management feature (refer to section 8.1.18.5). This counter shall not wrap once the value FFFFFFFFh is reached. A value of 0h, indicates that this transition has never occurred or this field is not implemented. |\n| 239:232 | **Operational Lifetime Energy Consumed (OLEC):** This field contains the cumulative operational energy consumed by the NVM subsystem in watt-hours calculated from all interval power measurements (i.e., average of power measurement samples over one second, refer to section 8.1.19) collected from the time of manufacture to the point that this log page is read. This value is rounded up (e.g., two indicates the number of watt-hours consumed is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3). This counter shall not wrap once the value FFFFFFFFh is reached. A value of 0h in this field indicates that the cumulative operational energy consumed by the NVM subsystem is not reported. |\n| 243:240 | **Interval Power Measurement (IPM):** This field contains the interval power measurement (i.e., average of power measurement samples over one second, refer to section 8.1.19) collected from the time of manufacture to the point that this log page is read. This value is equal to the value in the Interval Power Measurement Value field multiplied by the scale indicated in the Interval Power Measurement Scale field.
