    "text": "This log page is used to provide SMART and general health information. The information provided is over\nthe life of the controller and is retained across power cycles unless otherwise specified. To request the\ncontroller log page, the namespace identifier specified is FFFFFFFFh or 0h. For compatibility with\nimplementations compliant with NVM Express Base Specification, Revision 1.4 and earlier, hosts should\nuse a namespace identifier of FFFFFFFFh to request the controller log page. The controller may also\nsupport requesting the log page on a per namespace basis, as indicated by the SMART Support bit of the\nLPA field in the Identify Controller data structure in Figure 328.\nIf the log page is not supported on a per namespace basis and:\n•\nif a namespace identifier other than 0h or FFFFFFFFh is specified by the host, then the controller\nshall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command; and\n•\nif a namespace identifier of 0h or FFFFFFFFh is specified by the host, then the controller returns\nthe controller log page.\nThere is no namespace specific information defined in the SMART / Health Information log page in this\nrevision of the specification, thus the controller log page and namespaces specific log page contain identical\ninformation.\nCritical warnings regarding the health of the NVM subsystem may be indicated via an asynchronous event\nnotification to the host. The warnings that result in an asynchronous event notification to the host are\nconfigured using the Set Features command; refer to section 5.2.26.1.5.\nPerformance may be calculated using parameters returned as part of the SMART / Health Information log.\nSpecifically, the number of Read or Write commands, the amount of data read or written, and the amount\nof controller busy time enables both I/Os per second and bandwidth to be calculated.\nThe log page returned is defined in Figure 210.",
