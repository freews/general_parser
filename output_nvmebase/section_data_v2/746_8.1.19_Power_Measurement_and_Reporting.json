    "text": "Power measurement and reporting is an optional set of independent capabilities which allows the host to\nutilize interval power measurements from one or more embedded power sensors in the NVM subsystem.\nAn interval power measurement is the smallest time-based power measurement reportable and used by\nthe NVM subsystem. Each interval power measurement of a power measurement type shall:\n•\nbe the average, over a one second interval, of the power measurement samples that are taken with\na sampling rate of less than or equal to the value reported in the Interval Power Measurement\nSample Rate (IPMSR) field in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328);\n•\nbe taken over non-overlapping one second intervals; and\n•\nbe based on measured power, unless otherwise specified.\nFigure 679 defines the power measurement types for power measurement and reporting capabilities and\nfields. The power measurement type specifies what power source to measure. A power measurement type\nof NVM subsystem total power is the aggregate power consumed by all components within the NVM\nsubsystem.\nInterval power measurements are not required to be taken:\n•\nduring a power cycle of the NVM subsystem;\n•\nif all controllers are in a non-operational power state;\n•\nduring the processing of an NVM Subsystem Reset; and\n•\nwhile the CSTS.SHST field is set to 10b (i.e., shutdown processing complete) in all controllers in\nthe NVM subsystem.\nA set of interval power measurements may be contiguous or non-contiguous in time. A set of interval power\nmeasurements is contiguous if they are from a continuous period of time without any gaps. Examples of\nactions that are able to cause a set of interval power measurements to be non-contiguous include:\n•\nremoving power from the NVM subsystem (i.e., a power cycle);\n•\nentering a non-operational power state;\n•\ninitiating an NVM Subsystem Reset; and\n•\nthe CSTS.SHST field becoming set to 10b (i.e., shutdown processing complete) in all controllers in\nthe NVM subsystem.\nFigure 680 lists the capabilities and fields for power measurement and reporting.\nIf an interval power measurement is reported in the Interval Power Measurement (IPM) field in the SMART /\nHealth Information log page, then interval power measurements shall be collected for that field.\nIf the cumulative operational energy consumed is reported in the Operational Lifetime Energy Consumed\n(OLEC) field in the SMART / Health Information log page, then interval power measurements shall be\ncollected for that field.\nThe collection of interval power measurements for the Power Threshold feature and Power Measurement\ncapability are dependent on whether the respective capabilities are enabled.\nIf:\n•\nan interval power measurement is reported in the Interval Power Measurement (IPM) field in the\nSMART / Health Information log page;\n•\nthe cumulative operational energy consumed is reported in the Operational Lifetime Energy\nConsumed (OLEC) field in the SMART / Health Information log page;\n•\nthe Power Threshold feature is supported; or\n•\nthe Power Measurement capability is supported,\nthen the controller shall set the Interval Power Measurement Sample Rate (IPMSR) field in the Identify\nController data structure (refer to Figure 328) to a non-zero value.\nFigure 681 defines the power scale for the:\n•\nInterval Power Scale (IPS) field (refer to Figure 158);\n•\nAverage Interval Power Scale (AIPWRS) field (refer to Figure 297);\n•\nMaximum Interval Power Scale (MIPWRS) field (refer to Figure 297);\n•\nPower Scale (PWRS) field (refer to Figure 298); and\n•\nPower Threshold Scale (PTS) field (refer to Figure 453).",
