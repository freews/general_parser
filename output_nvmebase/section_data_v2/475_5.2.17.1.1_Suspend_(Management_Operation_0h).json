    "text": "The Suspend management operation of the Migration Send command allows a host to specify the type of\nsuspend to be done on the specified controller.\nThe Suspend management operation uses the Command Dword 11 field as defined in Figure 367 and does\nnot use the Management Operation Specific field.\nA Suspend Type field value of 0h (i.e., Suspend Notification) allows a host to notify a controller that the\ncontroller specified by the Controller Identifier field is going to be requested to suspend with a subsequent\nMigration Send command specifying a Suspend management operation and a non-zero value in the\nSuspend Type field.\nA Suspend Type field value of 1h (i.e., Suspend) specifies that the controller specified in the Controller\nIdentifier field (refer to Figure 367) is to be suspended. That controller shall perform the following actions\nand then stop initiating transport transactions:\n1. Stop fetching commands until the specified controller is no longer suspended (refer to section\n8.1.13).\n2. Complete the processing of all previously fetched commands, if any, except any outstanding\nAsynchronous Event Request commands.\nIf:\n•\nthe command causes the specified controller to be suspended; and\n•\nthere is a User Data Migration Queue associated with that specified controller,\nthen:\n•\nIf the DUDMQ bit is set to ‘1’, then the controller processing the command before posting the\ncompletion queue entry to the command shall delete that User Data Migration Queue; and\n•\nafter the specified controller completes the processing of all previously fetched commands, if any,\nexcept any outstanding Asynchronous Event Request commands, the controller processing the\nMigration Send command shall, at a vendor specific amount of time, posts an entry in that User\nData Migration Queue that indicates the specified controller is suspended as specified by the\napplicable NVM Express I/O Command Set specification.\nIt is not an error if a suspend operation occurs on a controller that is already suspended with the same\nSuspend Type value.\nIf the result of this command causes the specified controller to be suspended, then the specified controller\nremains suspended until:\n•\na Migration Send command specifying the Resume management operation (refer to section\n5.2.17.1.2) on the specified controller is completed successfully; or\n•\na Controller Level Reset occurs on the controller processing this command.\nIf a controller is suspended, then:\n•\naccesses to controller properties for that suspended controller shall behave normally except a host\nmodification of the CC property that sets CC.EN bit from ‘0’ to ‘1’ (i.e., enabling that suspended\ncontroller) has implementation specific behavior (i.e., the suspended controller may or may not set\nthe CSTS.RDY bit). A host should avoid modifications to controller properties, CMB, and PMR to a\ncontroller that is suspended;\n•\nthe Controller Memory Buffer (CMB), if supported, shall behave as defined in section 8.2.1 (i.e.,\nCMB on a suspended controller continues to function normally); and\n•\nthe Persistent Memory Region (PMR), if supported, shall behave as defined in section 8.2.4 (i.e.,\nPMR on a suspended controller continues to function normally).",
