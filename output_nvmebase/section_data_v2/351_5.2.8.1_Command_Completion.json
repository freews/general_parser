    "text": "Upon completion of the Firmware Commit command, the controller posts a completion queue entry to the\nAdmin Completion Queue indicating the status for the command.\nFor Firmware Commit commands that specify activation of a new firmware image at the next Controller\nLevel Reset (i.e., the CA field was set to 001b or 010b) and complete with a status code value of 0h (i.e.,\nSuccess Completion), a Controller Level Reset initiated by any of the methods defined in section 3.7.2\nactivates the specified firmware.\nIf the controller detects overlapping firmware/boot partition image update command sequences (refer to\nsection 1.5.42) of more than one firmware image and/or Boot Partition or the use of more than one controller\nand/or Management Endpoint to update a single firmware image, then the results of that detection are\nreported in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry as defined in Figure 186. Refer to section 3.11 and\nsection 8.1.3.2.\nIf:\na) the Commit Action field is cleared to 000b (i.e., update the firmware image in the specified firmware\nslot but do not activate);\nb) the Firmware Slot field is set to the active firmware slot (refer to Figure 212); and\nc) the controller supports greater than one firmware slot for a host to store firmware images,\nthen the controller may abort the command with a status code of Command Sequence Error. A host may\navoid this result by using a different firmware slot.\nFirmware Commit command specific status values (i.e., SCT field set to 1h) are shown in Figure 187.",
