Activating an inactive Keep Alive Timer (e.g., a Set Features\ncommand successfully setting the Keep Alive Timeout value to a non-zero value from a value of 0h, or the\nhost enabling a controller that supports NVMe over Fabrics where the Connect command specified a non-\nzero Keep Alive Timeout value (refer to Figure 579)) shall initialize the Keep Alive Timer to the Keep Alive\nTimeout value.\nWhile the Keep Alive Timer is active, the host should ensure that the Admin Submission Queue has space\nfor a Keep Alive command.",
