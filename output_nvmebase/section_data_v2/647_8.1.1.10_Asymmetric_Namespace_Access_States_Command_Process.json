If the ANA state is ANA Change State, then commands that use feature identifiers or log pages that are not available shall abort with a status code of Asymmetric Access Transition. |\n| | | 2. I/O Command Set specific definition. Refer to each I/O Command Set specification for applicability and additional details, if any. |\n| | | 3. If any namespace that is attached to the controller is in an ANA Group that is in the ANA Inaccessible state, the ANA Persistent Loss state, or the ANA Change state, then the command shall abort with the indicated status. Depending on the ANA state of the ANA Group that contains a namespace (e.g., an ANA state changes during the processing of the command), the specified feature identifier may be altered for some attached namespaces and not altered for other attached namespaces. |"
