##### 3.3.3.1 Queue Size

> **Section ID**: 3.3.3.1 | **Page**: 124-124

The queue size is the number of slots in the queue. The minimum size for a queue is two slots. The
maximum size for either an I/O Submission Queue or an I/O Completion Queue is defined as 65,536 slots,
limited by the maximum queue size supported by the controller that is reported in the CAP.MQES field. The
maximum size for the Admin Submission Queue and Admin Completion Queue is defined as 4,096 slots.
One slot in each queue is not available for use due to Head and Tail entry pointer definition.
For Message-based controllers, the maximum size for the Admin Submission Queue is limited by the value
indicated in the ASQSZ field in the Discovery Log Page Entry data structure (refer to Figure 310).
