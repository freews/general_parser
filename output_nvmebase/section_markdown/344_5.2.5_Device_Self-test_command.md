#### 5.2.5 Device Self-test command

> **Section ID**: 5.2.5 | **Page**: 216-218

The Device Self-test command is used to start a device self-test operation or abort a device self-test
operation (refer to section 8.1.8). The Device Self-test command is used specifically to:
a) start a short device self-test operation;
b) start an extended device self-test operation;
c) start a Host-Initiated Refresh operation;
d) start a vendor specific device self-test operation; or
e) abort a device self-test operation already in process.
A Host-Initiated Refresh operation is a device self-test operation.
The device self-test operation is performed by the controller that the Device Self-test command was
submitted to. The Namespace Identifier field controls which namespaces are included in the device self-
test operation as specified in Figure 174. For a Host-Initiated Refresh operation, the Namespace Identifier
field shall be ignored by the controller.
The Device Self-test command uses the Command Dword 10 field and the Command Dword 15 field. All
other command specific fields are reserved.
The processing of a Device Self-test command and interactions with a device self-test operation already in
progress is defined in Figure 177.
