#### 5.2.5 Device Self-test command

> **Section ID**: 5.2.5 | **Page**: 216-218

The Device Self-test command is used to start a device self-test operation or abort a device self-test
operation (refer to section 8.1.8). The Device Self-test command is used specifically to:
a) start a short device self-test operation;
b) start an extended device self-test operation;
c) start a Host-Initiated Refresh operation;
d) start a vendor specific device self-test operation; or
e) abort a device self-test operation already in process.
A Host-Initiated Refresh operation is a device self-test operation.
The device self-test operation is performed by the controller that the Device Self-test command was
submitted to. The Namespace Identifier field controls which namespaces are included in the device self-
test operation as specified in Figure 174. For a Host-Initiated Refresh operation, the Namespace Identifier
field shall be ignored by the controller.
The Device Self-test command uses the Command Dword 10 field and the Command Dword 15 field. All
other command specific fields are reserved.
The processing of a Device Self-test command and interactions with a device self-test operation already in
progress is defined in Figure 177.

| NSID Value | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| 00000000h | Specifies that the device self-test operation shall not include any namespaces, and only the controller is included as part of the device self-test operation. |
| 00000001h to FFFFFFFFh | Specifies that the device self-test operation shall include the specified namespace. If this field specifies an invalid namespace ID, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Namespace or Format. If this field specifies an inactive namespace ID, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command. |
| FFFFFFFFh | Specifies that the device self-test operation shall include all attached namespaces accessible through the controller at the time the device self-test operation is started. |

| Notes: | |
| 1. | If the Single Device Self-test Operation (SDSO) bit is cleared to '0' in the Device Self-test Options (DSTO) of the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328), then the Self-test in Progress column represents that a device self-test operation is in progress on the controller that the new Self-test command was received on. If the SDSO bit is set to '1', then the Self-test in Progress column represents that a device self-test operation is in progress on the controller that the new Self-test command was received on. |
