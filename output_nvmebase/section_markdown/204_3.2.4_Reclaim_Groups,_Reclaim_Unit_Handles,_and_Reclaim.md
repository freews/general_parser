#### 3.2.4 Reclaim Groups, Reclaim Unit Handles, and Reclaim Units

> **Section ID**: 3.2.4 | **Page**: 107-108

If Flexible Data Placement is enabled in an Endurance Group (refer to section 5.2.26.1.20), then the logical
view of the non-volatile storage capacity in that Endurance Group is shown in Figure 70 and consists of:
•
a set of one or more Reclaim Groups numbered from 0 to P -1 where P is the value of the Number
of Reclaim Groups field in the FDP Configuration Descriptor (refer to Figure 287). A Reclaim Group
consists of one or more Reclaim Units; and
•
one or more Reclaim Unit Handles numbered from 0 to N -1 where N is the value of the Number of
Reclaim Unit Handles field in the FDP Configuration Descriptor (refer to Figure 287).
A Reclaim Unit Handle consists of a reference to a Reclaim Unit in each Reclaim Group where user data
from a write command is placed. A Reclaim Unit referenced by the Reclaim Unit Handle is only allowed to
be referenced by at most one Reclaim Unit Handle. However, a specific Reclaim Unit is referenced by the
same or different Reclaim Unit Handles as the Reclaim Unit is cycled from erased and back into use. When
a Reclaim Unit is written to capacity, the controller updates that Reclaim Unit Handle to reference a different
Reclaim Unit that is available for writing user data (e.g., non-volatile storage media that has been erased
which is required prior to writing for program in place memories) and has not been written with any user
data (i.e., an empty Reclaim Unit). Refer to section 8.1.11 for the details of how a host is able to issue a
write command and place the user data into a Reclaim Unit.
