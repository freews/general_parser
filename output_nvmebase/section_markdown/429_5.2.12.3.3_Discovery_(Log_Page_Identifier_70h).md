###### 5.2.12.3.3 Discovery (Log Page Identifier 70h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.3.3 | **Page**: 330-336

The Discovery log page shall only be supported by Discovery controllers. The Discovery log page shall not
be supported by controllers that expose namespaces for NVMe over PCIe or NVMe over Fabrics. The
Discovery log page provides an inventory of NVM subsystems with which a host may attempt to form an
association. Depending on the parameters specified in a Get Log Page command, the Discovery log page
may contain entries for:
•
all known NVM subsystems; or
•
a subset of entries specific to the host or Discovery controller requesting the log page.
The Discovery log page is persistent across power cycles.
Figure 308 specifies the format for the LID Specific Parameter field in the Supported Log Pages log page
(refer to section 5.2.12.1.1) for the Discovery log page.
If a Discovery controller supports returning Extended Discovery Log Page Entries (i.e., the Extended
Discovery Log Page Entries Supported (EXTDLPES) bit is set to ‘1’ in the LID Specific Parameter field as
defined in Figure 308) and that Discovery controller processes a Get Log Page command for this log page
with the Extended Discovery Log Page Entries (EXTDLPE) bit set to ‘1’ in the Log Specific Parameter (LSP)
field (refer to Figure 309), then each entry returned by that Discovery controller may be either a Discovery
Log Page Entry or an Extended Discovery Log Page Entry. Extended Discovery Log Page Entries may
contain zero or more extended attributes. If a Discovery controller returns records that include Extended
Discovery Log Page Entries, then that Discovery controller shall set the Extended (EXTEND) bit to ‘1’ in
the Discovery Log Page Flags (DLPF) field. A Centralized Discovery controller (CDC) shall support
returning Extended Discovery Log Page Entries.
If a Discovery controller supports returning only port local Discovery Log Page Entries or port local Extended
Discovery Log Page Entries (i.e., the Port Local Entries Only Supported (PLEOS) bit is set to ‘1’ in the LID
Specific Parameter field as defined in Figure 308) and that Discovery controller processes a Get Log Page
command for this log page with the Port Local Entries Only (PLEO) bit set to ‘1’ in the LSP field (refer to
Figure 309), then that Discovery controller shall return records for only NVM subsystem ports that are
presented through the same NVM subsystem port that received the Get Log Page command. If a Discovery
controller returns records for only NVM subsystem ports that are presented through the same NVM
subsystem port that received the Get Log Page command, then that Discovery controller shall set the Port
Local (PORTLCL) bit to ‘1’ in the DLPF field. Only a Direct Discovery controller (DDC) may support returning
only port local Discovery Log Page Entries or port local Extended Discovery Log Page Entries.
If a Discovery controller supports returning records for all NVM subsystem ports that are registered (i.e.,
the All NVM Subsystems Entries Supported (ALLSUBES) bit is set to ‘1’ in the LID Specific Parameter field
as defined in Figure 308) and that Discovery controller processes a Get Log Page command for this log
page with the All NVM Subsystem Entries (ALLSUBE) bit set to ‘1’ in the LSP field (refer to Figure 309),
then that Discovery controller shall return records for all NVM subsystem ports that are registered. The list
of records returned by that Discovery controller shall not be filtered based upon the requesting HOSTNQN.
If a Discovery controller returns records for all NVM subsystem ports that are registered, then that Discovery
controller shall set the All Subsystems (ALLSUB) bit to ‘1’ in the DLPF field. A Discovery controller may
require authentication before reporting the ALLSUBES bit being set to ‘1’ or may require configuration
outside the scope of this specification.
The Log Page Offset may be used to retrieve specific records. If the Discovery controller supports an index
offset for this log page (i.e., the Index Offset Supported (IOS) bit is set to ‘1’ in the Supported Log Pages
log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.1) for this log page) and the OT bit is set to ‘1’ in a Get Log Page
command, then the index values specified in the Log Page Offset Lower (LPOL) field (refer to Figure 203)
and Log Page Offset Upper (LPOU) field (refer to Figure 204) in that Get Log Page command shall be used
to index into the header and list of entries within this log page (e.g., specifying an index offset of 0 returns
this log page starting at the header, specifying an index offset of 1 returns this log page starting at the offset
of Entry 0, etc.).
The number of records (i.e., the number of Discovery Log Page Entries) is returned in the header of the log
page. The format for a Discovery Log Page Entry is defined in Figure 310. The format for an Extended
Discovery Log Page Entry is defined in Figure 311. The format for an extended attribute is defined in Figure
533. The format for the Discovery log page is defined in Figure 312.
A single Get Log Page command used to read the Discovery log page shall be atomic. If the Discovery log
page is read using multiple Get Log Page commands, then the reader should validate the Generation
Counter field to ensure that there has not been a change in the contents of the data. The Discovery log
page contents should be processed in the following sequence:
1. read the Discovery log page contents in order (i.e., with increasing Log Page Offset values);
2. re-read the Generation Counter field after the entire log page is transferred; and
3. if the Generation Counter field does not match the original value read, then discard the log page
read, as the entries may be inconsistent, and restart the sequence.; or
4. if the Generation Counter field does match the original value read, then process the returned data.
If the log page contents change during this command sequence, then the controller may return a status
code of Discover Restart.
Every record indicates via the SUBTYPE field if that record is describing the current Discovery Service,
referring to another Discovery Service, or if the record indicates an NVM subsystem composed of
controllers that may expose namespaces. A referral to another Discovery Service (i.e., SUBTYPE field set
to 01h) is a mechanism to find additional Discovery subsystems. An NVM subsystem entry (i.e., SUBTYPE
field set to 02h) is a mechanism to find NVM subsystems that contain controllers that may expose
namespaces. An entry that describes the current Discovery Service (i.e., SUBTYPE field set to 03h) is a
mechanism to find additional access information (e.g., other NVM subsystem ports) for the current
Discovery service. Hosts or Discovery controllers are not required to process referral entries deeper than
eight levels.
For entries that describe the current Discovery Service, the DUPRETINFO bit set to ‘1’ in the Entry Flags
field indicates those ports that return duplicate information. A host need not retrieve the Discovery Log Page
from all NVM subsystem ports described by a Discovery Log Page Entry that contains the DUPRETINFO
bit set to ‘1’ (refer to Figure 310), as each of those ports return the same information. A host may retrieve
the Discovery Log Page from multiple ports with the DUPRETINFO bit set to ‘1’ to act as redundant access
to the same information. A host may choose to enable the Discovery Log Page Change AEN on one of the
connections associated with an entry with the DUPRETINFO bit set to ‘1’. If the Discovery Log Page Change
AEN is enabled on multiple ports represented by entries with the DUPRETINFO bit set to ‘1’, then the host
may process a Discovery Log Page Change AEN for one connection as applying to all ports represented
by entries that also have the DUPRETINFO bit set to ‘1’.
If an NVM subsystem supports the dynamic controller model, then all entries for that NVM subsystem shall
have the Controller ID field set to FFFFh. For a particular NVM subsystem port and NVMe Transport
address in an NVM subsystem, there shall be no more than one entry with the Controller ID field set to:
•
FFFFh if that NVM subsystem supports the dynamic controller model; or
•
FFFEh if that NVM subsystem supports the static controller model.
