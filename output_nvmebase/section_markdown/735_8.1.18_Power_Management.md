#### 8.1.18 Power Management

> **Section ID**: 8.1.18 | **Page**: 611-612

The power management capability allows the host to manage NVM subsystem power statically or
dynamically. Static power management consists of the host determining the maximum power that may be
allocated to an NVM subsystem and setting the NVM Express power state to one that consumes this
amount of power or less. Dynamic power management is illustrated in Figure 672 and consists of the host
modifying the NVM Express power state to best satisfy changing power and performance objectives. This
power management mechanism is meant to complement and not replace autonomous power management
or thermal management performed by a controller.
The number of power states implemented by a controller is returned in the Number of Power States
Supported (NPSS) field in the Identify Controller data structure. If the controller supports this feature, at
least one power state shall be defined and optionally, up to a total of 32 power states may be supported.
Power states shall be contiguously numbered starting with zero such that each subsequent power state
consumes less than or equal to the maximum power consumed in the previous state. Thus, power state
zero indicates the maximum power that the NVM subsystem is capable of consuming.
Associated with each power state is a Power State Descriptor in the Identify Controller data structure (refer
to Figure 329). The descriptors for all implemented power states may be viewed as forming a table as
shown in the example in Figure 673 for a controller with seven implemented power states. Note that Figure
673 is illustrative and does not include all fields in the power state descriptor. The Maximum Power (MP)
field indicates the sustained maximum power that may be consumed in that state, where power
measurement methods are outside the scope of this specification. The controller may employ autonomous
power management techniques to reduce power consumption below this level, but under no circumstances
is power allowed to exceed this level except for non-operational power states as described in section
8.1.18.1.
The Idle Power (IDLP) field indicates the typical power consumed by the NVM subsystem over 30 seconds
in the power state when idle (e.g., there are no pending commands, property accesses, background
processes, nor device self-test operations). The measurement starts after the NVM subsystem has been
idle for 10 seconds.
The Active Power (ACTP) field indicates the largest average power of the NVM subsystem over a 10 second
window on a particular workload (refer to section 8.1.18.3). Active Power measurement starts when the first
command is submitted and ends when the last command is completed. The largest average power over a
10 second window, consumed by the NVM subsystem in that state is reported in the Active Power field. If
the workload completes faster than 10 seconds, the average active power should be measured over the
period of the workload. Non-operational states shall set Active Power Scale, Active Power Workload, and
Active Power fields to 0h.
The host may dynamically modify the power state using the Set Features command and determine the
current power state using the Get Features command. The host may directly transition between any two
supported power states. The Entry Latency (ENLAT) field in the Power State Descriptor data structure
indicates the maximum amount of time in microseconds to enter that power state and the Exit Latency
(EXLAT) field indicates the maximum amount of time in microseconds to exit that state.
The maximum amount of time to transition between any two power states is equal to the sum of the old
state’s exit latency and the new state’s entry latency. The host is not required to wait for a previously
submitted power state transition to complete before initiating a new transition. The maximum amount of
time for a sequence of power state transitions to complete is equal to the sum of transition times for each
individual power state transition in the sequence.
Associated with each power state descriptor are Relative Read Throughput (RRT), Relative Write
Throughput (RWT), Relative Read Latency (RRL) and Relative Write Latency (RWL) fields that provide the
host with an indication of relative performance in that power state. Relative performance values provide an
ordering of performance characteristics between power states. Relative performance values may repeat,
may be skipped, and may be assigned in any order (i.e., increasing power states are not required to have
increasing relative performance values).
A lower relative performance value indicates better performance (e.g., higher throughput or lower latency).
For example, in Figure 673 power state 1 has higher read throughput than power state 2, and power states
0 through 3 all have the same read latency. Relative performance ordering is only with respect to a single
performance characteristic. Thus, although the relative read throughput value of one power state may equal
the relative write throughput value of another power state, this does not imply that the actual read and write
performance of these two power states are equal.
The default NVM Express power state is implementation specific and shall correspond to a state that does
not consume more power than the lowest value specified in the applicable form factor specification, if any.
Refer to the Power Management section in the applicable NVM Express Transport specification for
transport specific power requirements impacting NVMe power states, if any.
