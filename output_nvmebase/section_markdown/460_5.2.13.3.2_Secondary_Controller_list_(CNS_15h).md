###### 5.2.13.3.2 Secondary Controller list (CNS 15h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.13.3.2 | **Page**: 395-396

A Secondary Controller List (refer to Figure 347) is returned to the host for up to 127 secondary controllers
associated with the primary controller processing this command. The list contains entries for controller
identifiers greater than or equal to the value specified in the Controller Identifier (CDW10.CNTID) field.
All secondary controllers are represented, including those that are in an Offline state due to SR-IOV
configuration settings (e.g., VF Enable is cleared to ‘0’ or NumVFs specifies a value that does not enable
the associated secondary controller).
