#### 5.2.25 Security Send command

> **Section ID**: 5.2.25 | **Page**: 421-422

The Security Send command is used to transfer security protocol data to the controller. The data structure
transferred to the controller as part of this command contains security protocol specific commands to be
performed by the controller. The data structure transferred may also contain data or parameters associated
with the security protocol commands. Status and data that is to be returned to the host for the security
protocol commands submitted by a Security Send command are retrieved with the Security Receive
command defined in section 5.2.23.
The association between a Security Send command and subsequent Security Receive command is
Security Protocol field dependent as defined in SPC-5.
If the Configurable Device Personality feature (refer to section 5.2.26.1.24) is supported and the Security
Personality is supported (refer to section 5.2.12.1.28), then the Security Send command may have
additional command processing considerations as described in section 5.2.26.1.24.3.
The fields used are Data Pointer, Command Dword 10, and Command Dword 11 fields. All other command
specific fields are reserved.
