##### 8.1.1.8 ANA Change state

> **Section ID**: 8.1.1.8 | **Page**: 543-544

The change from one asymmetric namespace access state to another asymmetric namespace access state
is called a transition. Transitions may occur in such a way that the ANA Change state is not visible to the
host (i.e., the ANA Change state may or may not be reported in the Asymmetric Namespace Access State
field in the Asymmetric Namespace Access log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.13)). Support for reporting
this state is optional.
A controller shall abort commands, other than those described in 8.1.1.10, with a status code of Asymmetric
Access Transition if those commands are submitted while the relationship between the specified
namespace and the controller processing the command is in this state.
While ANA Change state is reported by a controller for the namespace, the host should:
a) after a short delay, retry the command on the same controller for at least ANATT (refer to Figure
328) seconds (e.g., if ANATT is 30, perform 3 retries at 10 s intervals, or 10 retries at 3 s intervals);
or
b) retry the command on a different controller that is reporting ANA Optimized state or ANA Non-
Optimized state.
