###### 5.2.13.2.8 I/O Command Set Independent Identify Namespace data structure (CNS 08h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.13.2.8 | **Page**: 384-388

If the Namespace Identifier (NSID) field specifies an active NSID, then the I/O Command Set Independent
Identify Namespace data structure (refer to Figure 335) is returned to the host for that specified namespace.
If the value in the NSID field specifies an inactive NSID, then the controller returns a zero filled data
structure.
The Reported column in Figure 335 specifies fields in the I/O Command Set Independent Identify
Namespace data structure that define namespace capabilities used by a host to format or create a
namespace. If the NSID field is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller shall return an I/O Command Set
Independent Identify Namespace data structure that:
•
for fields in Figure 335 that indicate “Yes” in the Reported column, contain the same value for all
namespaces; and
•
for fields in Figure 335 that indicate “No” in the Reported column, contain a value cleared to 0h.
If the controller supports the Namespace Management capability (refer to section 8.1.16) and the NSID
field is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller shall return an I/O Command Set Independent Identify
Namespace data structure. If the controller does not support the Namespace Management capability and
the NSID field is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller may abort the command with a status code of Invalid
Namespace or Format.

| 00 | M | **Common Namespace Features (NSFEAT):** This field defines features of the namespace. | No |
| | | | |
| | | **Bits** | **Description** |
| | | 7:6 | Reserved |
| | | 5 | **Volatile Write Cache Not Present (VWCPN):** This bit indicates that a volatile write cache is not present for this namespace.<br>If this bit is set to '1', then there is no volatile write cache present for this namespace and the host should ignore the Volatile Write Cache Present bit in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328)<br>If this bit is cleared to '0', then the presence of a volatile write cache for this namespace is defined in the Volatile Write Cache bit in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328). |
| | | 4 | **Rotational Media (RMEDIA):** If this bit is set to '1', then the namespace stores data on rotational media (refer to section 8.1.25). If this bit is cleared to '0', then the namespace does not store data on rotational media. |
| | | 3 | **UID Reuse (UIDREUSE):** If this bit is set to '1', then the value in the NGUID field for this namespace is never reused by the controller and that the value in the EUI64 field for this namespace, if non-zero, is never reused by the controller. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the NGUID value may be reused and the EUI64 value may be reused by the controller for a new namespace created after this namespace is deleted. This bit shall be cleared to '0' if both NGUID and EUI64 fields are cleared to 0h. Refer to section 4.7.1. |
| | | 2:0 | Reserved |
| | | | |
| 01 | O | **Namespace Multi-path I/O and Namespace Sharing Capabilities (NMIC):** This field specifies multi-path I/O and namespace sharing capabilities of the namespace. | Yes |
| | | | |
| | | **Bits** | **Description** |
| | | 7:2 | Reserved |
| | | 1 | **Dispersed Namespace (DISNS):** If this bit is set to '1', then the namespace is a dispersed namespace (refer to section 8.1.10). If this bit is set to '1', then the namespace shall be a shared namespace (i.e., the Shared Namespace (SHRNS) bit shall be set to '1'). If this bit is cleared to '0', then the namespace is not a dispersed namespace. |
| | | 0 | **Shared Namespace (SHRNS):** If this bit is set to '1', then the namespace may be attached to two or more controllers in the NVM subsystem concurrently (i.e., may be a shared namespace). If this bit is cleared to '0', then the namespace is a private namespace and is able to be attached to only one controller at a time. |
| | | | |
| 02 | O | **Reservation Capabilities (RESCAP):** This field indicates the reservation capabilities of the namespace. A value of 0h in this field indicates that reservations are not supported by this namespace. Refer to section 8.1.24 for more details. | No |
| | | | |
| | | **Bits** | **Description** |
| | | 7 | **Ignore Existing Key Support (IEKS):** If this bit is set to '1', then the Ignore Existing Key is used as defined in NVM Express Base Specification revision 1.3 or later. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the Ignore Existing Key is used as defined in NVM Express Base Specification revision 1.2.1 or earlier. This bit shall be set to '1' if the controller supports revision 1.3 or later as indicated in the Version property. |
| | | 6 | **Exclusive Access – All Registrants Support (EAARS):** If this bit is set to '1', then the namespace supports the Exclusive Access – All Registrants reservation type. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the namespace does not support the Exclusive Access – All Registrants reservation type. |
| | | 5 | **Write Exclusive – All Registrants Support (WEARS):** If this bit is set to '1', then the namespace supports the Write Exclusive – All Registrants reservation type. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the namespace does not support the Write Exclusive – All Registrants reservation type. |
| | | 4 | **Exclusive Access – Registrants Only Support (EAIROS):** If this bit is set to '1', then the namespace supports the Exclusive Access – Registrants Only reservation type. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the namespace does not support the Exclusive Access – Registrants Only reservation type. |
| | | 3 | **Write Exclusive – Registrants Only Support (WEROIS):** If this bit is set to '1', then the namespace supports the Write Exclusive – Registrants Only reservation type. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the namespace does not support the Write Exclusive – Registrants Only reservation type. |
| | | 2 | **Exclusive Access Support (EAS):** If this bit is set to '1', then the namespace supports the Exclusive Access reservation type. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the namespace does not support the Exclusive Access reservation type. |

If the FPIS bit is set to '1', then the namespace is formatted with the format specified by Identify Namespace data structures (refer to section 1.5.50) and there is no Format NVM command in progress.<br>If the FPIS bit is cleared to '0', then this field shall be cleared to 0h. |
