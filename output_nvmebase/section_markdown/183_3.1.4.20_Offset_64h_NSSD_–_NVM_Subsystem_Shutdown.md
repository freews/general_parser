##### 3.1.4.20 Offset 64h: NSSD – NVM Subsystem Shutdown

> **Section ID**: 3.1.4.20 | **Page**: 95-95

This optional property provides a host with the capability to initiate a normal or an abrupt NVM Subsystem
Shutdown.
Support for this property is indicated by the state of the NVM Subsystem Shutdown Supported (CAP.NSSS)
field. If this property is not supported, then the address range occupied by this property is reserved.
The NVM Subsystem Shutdown Enhancements Supported (CAP.NSSES) bit affects the functionality
invoked by host modification of this property (refer to section 3.6.3).

| 31:00 | RW | 0h | NVM Subsystem Shutdown Control (NSSC): A write of the value 4E726D6Ch ("NrmI") to this field initiates a normal NVM Subsystem Shutdown on every controller.<br>• in the domain associated with the controller when CAP.CPS is set to 10b (i.e., domain scope) as specified in section 3.6.3.2 or<br>• in the NVM subsystem when CAP.CPS is set to 11b (i.e., NVM subsystem scope) as specified in section 3.6.3.1.<br>A write of the value 41627074h ("Abpt") to this field initiates an abrupt NVM subsystem shutdown on every controller.<br>• in the domain associated with the controller when CAP.CPS is set to 10b as specified in section 3.6.3.2; or<br>• in the NVM subsystem when CAP.CPS is set to 11b in the NVM subsystem as specified in section 3.6.3.1.<br>A write of any other value to this field has no functional effect on the operation of the NVM subsystem. This field shall return the value 0h when read. |
