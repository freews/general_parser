###### 8.3.5.5.10 Mapping of DH-HMAC-CHAP Messages to Authentication Commands

> **Section ID**: 8.3.5.5.10 | **Page**: 757-757

The DH-HMAC-CHAP_Reply message and the DH-HMAC-CHAP_Success2 message are sent from the
host to the controller, therefore they are mapped to the Authentication Send command. The DH-HMAC-
CHAP_Challenge message and the DH-HMAC-CHAP_Success1 message are sent from the controller to
the host, therefore they are mapped to the Authentication Receive command.
