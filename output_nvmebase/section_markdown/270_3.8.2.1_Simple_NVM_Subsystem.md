##### 3.8.2.1 Simple NVM Subsystem

> **Section ID**: 3.8.2.1 | **Page**: 147-147

Figure 86 shows an example of a single domain NVM subsystem where endurance is managed across all
media units. The performance goal is maximum bandwidth, which is achieved by allowing each read or
write operation to simultaneously access all Media Units. All Media Units are in the same Endurance Group
and in the same NVM Set.
The Capacity Configuration Descriptor for this example contains one Endurance Group Configuration
Descriptor. The Endurance Group Configuration Descriptor contains one NVM Set Identifier and four
Channel Configuration Descriptors. Each Channel Configuration Descriptor contains four Media Unit
Configuration Descriptors.
