###### 5.2.12.1.13 Asymmetric Namespace Access (Log Page Identifier 0Ch)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.13 | **Page**: 258-260

This log page consists of a header describing the log and descriptors containing the asymmetric namespace
access information for ANA Groups (refer to section 8.1.1.2) that contain namespaces that are attached to
the controller processing the command. If ANA Reporting (refer to section 8.1.1) is supported, this log page
is supported. ANA Group Descriptors shall be returned in ascending ANA Group Identifier order.
If the Index Offset Supported bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the LID Support and Effects data structure for this log
page (refer to Figure 208), then:
•
if the RGO bit is cleared to ‘0’ in Command Dword 10, then the LPOL field in Command Dword 12
and the LPOU field in Command Dword 13 of the Get Log Page command should be cleared to
0h.
If the Index Offset Supported bit is set to ‘1’ in the LID Supported and Effects data structure for this log page
(refer to Figure 208) and the OT bit is set to ‘1’, then an index value specified in the Log Page Offset Lower
(LPOL) field (refer to Figure 203) and the Log Page Offset Upper (LPOU) field (refer to Figure 204) in the
Get Log Page command shall be used to index to the header or an ANA Group Descriptor within the list of
ANA Group Descriptors as shown in Figure 227 (e.g., specifying an index offset of 0 returns this log page
starting at byte offset 0h, specifying an index offset of 1 returns this log page starting at the offset of ANA
Group Descriptor 0, specifying an index offset of 2 returns this log page starting at the offset of ANA Group
Descriptor 1, etc.). Due to the complexity of using a byte offset with a variable sized ANA Group Descriptor,
the host should use an index offset by setting the OT bit to ‘1’ in Command Dword 14 of the Get Log Page
command.
If the host performs multiple Get Log Page commands to read the ANA log page (e.g., using the LPOL field
or the LPOU field), the host should re-read the header of the log page and ensure that the Change Count
field in the Asymmetric Namespace Access log matches the original value read. If it does not match, then
the data captured is not consistent and the ANA log page should be re-read.
The Log Specific Parameter field in Command Dword 10 (refer to Figure 201) for this log page is defined
in Figure 226.
The format of the ANA Group Descriptor is defined in Figure 228. Namespace Identifiers shall be listed in
ascending NSID order.
