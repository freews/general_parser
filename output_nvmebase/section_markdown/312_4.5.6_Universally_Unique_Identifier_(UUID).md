#### 4.5.6 Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)

> **Section ID**: 4.5.6 | **Page**: 190-190

The Universally Unique Identifier is defined in RFC 9562 and contained in the Namespace Identification
Descriptor (refer to Figure 331). Byte ordering requirements for a UUID are described in RFC 9562.
For historical reasons, UUID subtypes are called UUID versions. Multiple UUID versions are able to be
used in the same implementation.
RFC 9562 defines UUID version 8 (i.e., UUIDv8) for experimental or vendor-specific use cases. Uniqueness
of UUIDv8 values is implementation specific. NVM Express UUID use cases assume uniqueness within the
set of hosts, NVM subsystems, and fabrics that are connected or accessible by a common instance of an
administrative tool. For UUIDv8 values, that uniqueness is the responsibility of all of the implementations
in that set. RFC 9562 Appendix B provides examples of UUIDv8 generation algorithms that produce unique
UUIDs if all implementations in that set generate UUIDv8 values with the same algorithm.
