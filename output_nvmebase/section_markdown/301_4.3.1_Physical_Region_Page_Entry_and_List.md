#### 4.3.1 Physical Region Page Entry and List

> **Section ID**: 4.3.1 | **Page**: 177-178

A physical region page (PRP) entry is a pointer to a physical memory page. PRPs are used as a
scatter/gather mechanism for data transfers between the controller and memory. To enable efficient out of
order data transfers between the controller and the host, PRP entries are a fixed size.
The size of the physical memory page is configured by a host in CC.MPS. Figure 109 shows the layout of
a PRP entry that consists of a Page Base Address and an Offset. The size of the Offset field is determined
by the physical memory page size configured in CC.MPS.
The definition of a PRP entry is described in Figure 110.
A physical region page list (PRP List) is a set of PRP entries in a single page of contiguous memory. A PRP
List describes additional PRP entries that could not be described within the command itself. Any PRP
entries described within the command are not duplicated in a PRP List. If the amount of data to transfer
requires multiple PRP List memory pages, then the last PRP entry before the end of the memory page shall
be a pointer to the next PRP List, indicating the next segment of the PRP List. Figure 111 shows the layout
of a PRP List where each PRP entry identifies memory pages that are physically contiguous. Figure 112
shows the layout of a PRP List where each PRP entry identifies a different memory page (i.e., the memory
pages are not physically contiguous).
Dependent on the command definition, the first PRP entry contained within the command may have a non-
zero offset within the memory page. The first PRP List entry (i.e., the first pointer to a memory page
containing additional PRP entries) that if present is typically contained in the PRP Entry 2 location within
the command, shall be qword aligned and may also have a non-zero offset within the memory page.
PRP entries contained within a PRP List shall have a memory page offset of 0h. If a second PRP entry is
present within a command, it shall have a memory page offset of 0h. In both cases, the entries are memory
page aligned based on the value in CC.MPS. If the controller receives a non-zero offset for these PRP
entries the controller should return an error of PRP Offset Invalid.
PRP Lists shall be minimally sized with packed entries starting with entry 0. If more PRP List pages are
required, then the last entry of the PRP List contains the Page Base Address of the next PRP List page.
The next PRP List page shall be memory page aligned. The total number of PRP entries required by a
command is implied by the command parameters and memory page size.
