###### 5.2.26.1.4 Volatile Write Cache (Feature Identifier 06h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.4 | **Page**: 428-429

This Feature controls the volatile write cache, if present, on the controller. If a volatile write cache is present
(refer to the VWC field in Figure 328), then this Feature shall be supported. The attributes are specified in
Command Dword 11.
Note: If the controller is able to guarantee that data present in a write cache is written to non-volatile storage
media on loss of power, then that write cache is considered non-volatile and this Feature does not apply to
that write cache.
If a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure 408 are returned
in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.
If a volatile write cache is not present, then a Set Features command specifying the Volatile Write Cache
feature identifier shall abort with a status code of Invalid Field in Command, and a Get Features command
specifying the Volatile Write Cache feature identifier shall abort with a status code of Invalid Field in
Command.
If a volatile write cache is present and the volatile write cache is disabled (i.e., the WCE bit is cleared to
‘0’), then the user data written by any command to a namespace shall be persistent. Refer to the Volatile
Write Cache Presence field contained in the Common Namespace Features field in Figure 335.
