| Bytes | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 03:00 | **Command Dword 0 (CDW0): Refer to Figure 95.** |
| | **Fabrics Command Type (FCTYPE):** This field specifies the Fabrics command transferred in the capsule. The Fabrics command types are defined in Figure 574. If this field is set to a reserved value, then the command shall be aborted with a status code of Invalid Field in Command. The format of the FCTYPE field is shown here: |
| | | |
| | | **Bits** | **Description** |
| | | **07:02** | **Function (FN):** This field contains a value that, in combination with the other fields in the Fabrics Command Type data structure, creates a unique Combined Fabrics Command Type. |
| | | **04** | **Data Transfer Direction (DTD):** This field indicates the direction of a data transfer, if any. All options of the command shall transfer data as specified or transfer no data. All commands, including vendor specific commands, shall follow this convention. |
| | | | |
| | | | **Value** | **Definition** |
| | | | **00b** | **No Data Transfer:** No data is transferred. |
| | | | **01b** | **Host to Controller Transfer:** Data is transferred from the host to the controller. |
| | | | **10b** | **Controller to Host Transfer:** Data is transferred from the controller to the host. |
| | | | **11b** | **Reserved** |
| | | **01:00** | |
| | | **23:05** | **Reserved** |
| | | **39:24** | **SGL Descriptor 1 (SGL1):** This field contains a Transport SGL Data Block descriptor or a Keyed SGL Data Block descriptor that describes the entire data transfer. Refer to section 4.3.2 for the definition of SGL descriptors. <br> This field is used for Fabrics commands that transfer data. If a Fabrics command does not transfer data, then this field is reserved. |
| | | **63:40** | **Fabrics Command Type Specific (FCTS):** This field is Fabrics command type specific. |
| | | | |
| | | **Bits** | **Description** |
| | | **31:16** | **Command Identifier (CID):** Refer to Figure 91. |
| | | | |
| | | | **PRP or SGL for Data Transfer (PSDT):** |
| | | | |
| | | | **Value** | **Definition** |
| | | | **00b** | **No Data Transferred:** This value is used for Fabrics commands that do not transfer data. <br> If this value is used for Fabrics commands that transfer data, then SGLs are used for this transfer. A host should use the value 10b rather than 00b for Fabrics commands that transfer data. |
| | | | **01b** | **Reserved** |
| | | | **10b** | **Data Transferred:** This value is used for Fabrics commands that transfer data. SGLs are used for this transfer. |
| | | | **11b** | **Reserved** |
| | | **15:14** | |
| | | **13:10** | **Reserved** |
| | | **09:08** | **Fused Operation (FUSE):** Refer to Figure 91. There are no fused Fabrics commands and as a result this field is cleared to 00b. |
| | | **07:00** | **Opcode (OPC):** This field is set to 7Fh to specify a Fabrics command. |
