###### 5.2.12.1.2 Error Information (Log Page Identifier 01h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.2 | **Page**: 236-237

This log page is used to describe extended error information for a command that completed with error or
report an error that is not specific to a particular command. Extended error information is provided when
the More (M) bit is set to ‘1’ in the Status field for the completion queue entry associated with the command
that completed with error or as part of an asynchronous event with an Error status type. This log page is
global to the controller.
This error log may return the last n errors. If the host specifies a data transfer of the size of n error logs,
then the error logs for the most recent n errors are returned. The ordering of the entries is based on the
time when the error occurred, with the most recent error being returned as the first log entry.
Each entry in the log page returned is defined in Figure 209. The log page is a set of 64-byte entries; the
maximum number of entries supported is indicated in the ELPE field in the Identify Controller data structure
(refer to Figure 328). If the log page is full when a new entry is generated, the controller should insert the
new entry into the log and discard the oldest entry.
The controller should clear this log page by removing all entries on power cycle and Controller Level Reset.

| Bytes | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 07:00 | **Error Count (ECNT):** This is a 64-bit incrementing error count, indicating a unique identifier for this error. The error count starts at 1h, is incremented for each unique error log entry, and is retained across power off conditions. A value of 0h indicates an invalid entry; this value is used when there are lost entries or when there are fewer than the maximum number of entries the controller supports.<br><br>If the value of this field is FFFFFFFF_FFFFFFFFh, then the field shall be set to 1h when incremented (i.e., rolls over to 1h). Prior to revision 1.4 of this specification, processing of incrementing beyond FFFFFFFFh is unspecified. |
| 09:08 | **Submission Queue ID (SQID):** This field indicates the Submission Queue Identifier of the command that the error information is associated with. If the error is not specific to a particular command, then this field shall be set to FFFFh. |
| 11:10 | **Command ID (CID):** This field indicates the Command Identifier of the command that the error is associated with. If the error is not specific to a particular command, then this field shall be set to FFFFh. |
| 13:12 | **Status Info (STS):**<br><table><tr><th>Bits</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>15:1</td><td>Status (STATUS): This field contains the Status field from the completion queue entry (refer to Figure 100) of the command that completed. If the error is not specific to a particular command, then this field reports the most applicable status value.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Phase Tag (P): This bit may indicate the Phase Tag posted for the command.</td></tr></table> |
| 15:14 | **Parameter Error Location (PEL):** This field indicates the byte and bit of the command parameter that the error is associated with, if applicable. If the parameter spans multiple bytes or bits, then the location indicates the least-significant byte and bit of the parameter.<br><table><tr><th>Bits</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>15:11</td><td>Reserved</td></tr><tr><td>10:08</td><td>Bit Location (BITLOC): The offset in the byte specified by the Byte Location field to the bit in that byte that contained the error.</td></tr><tr><td>07:00</td><td>Byte Location (BYTLOC): The offset in the submission queue entry to the byte in the command that contained the error. Valid values are based on the SQES field (refer to section 5.2.12.3.3). If the error is not transport related, this field shall be cleared to 0h. If the error is transport related, this field shall be set to the type of the transport as defined in the TRTYPEn field within Figure 310.</td></tr></table><br>If the error is not specific to a particular command, then this field shall be set to FFFFh. |
| 23:16 | **Logical Block Address (LBA):** This field indicates I/O Command Set specific data about the error condition, if applicable. The description is described in the applicable NVM Express I/O Command Set specification.<br>NOTE: The original field name has been retained for historical continuity. |
| 27:24 | **Namespace Identifier (NSID):** This field indicates the NSID of the namespace that the error is associated with, if applicable. |
| 28 | **Vendor Specific Information Available (VSIA):** If there is additional vendor specific error information available, this field provides the log page identifier associated with that page. A value of 0h indicates that no additional information is available. Valid values are in the range of 80h to FFh. |
| 29 | **Transport Type (TRTYPEn):** This field indicates the Transport Type of the transport associated with the error. The values in this field are the same as the TRTYPE values in the Discovery Log Page Entry (refer to section 5.2.12.3.3). If the error is not transport related, this field shall be cleared to 0h. If the error is transport related, this field shall be set to the type of the transport as defined in the TRTYPEn field within Figure 310. |
| 30 | **Command Set Indicator (CSI):** This field contains command set indicator for the command that the error is associated with. This field is valid if the Log Page Version field is greater than or equal to 1h. |
| 31 | **Opcode (OPC):** This field contains opcode for the command that the error is associated with. This field is valid if the Log Page Version field is greater than or equal to 1h.<br>This field, the CSI field, and the Submission Queue ID field uniquely indicate the command and the command set. |
| 39:32 | **Command Specific Information (CSINFO):** This field contains the command specific information. If used, the command definition specifies the information returned. |
| 41:40 | **Transport Type Specific Information (TTSI):** This field indicates additional transport type specific error information. If multiple errors exist, then this field indicates additional information about the first error. This field is transport type dependent (refer to TRTYPEn) as follows:<br><table><tr><th>Transport Type</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>All other values</td><td>Reserved</td></tr><tr><td>3h</td><td>This field indicates the offset, in bytes, from the start of the Transport Header to the start of the field that is in error. If multiple errors exist, then this field indicates the lowest offset that is in error.</td></tr></table> |
| 62:42 | Reserved |
| 63 | **Log Page Version (LPVER):** This field shall be set to 1h. |
