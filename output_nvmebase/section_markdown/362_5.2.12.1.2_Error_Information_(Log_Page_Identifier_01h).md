###### 5.2.12.1.2 Error Information (Log Page Identifier 01h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.2 | **Page**: 236-237

This log page is used to describe extended error information for a command that completed with error or
report an error that is not specific to a particular command. Extended error information is provided when
the More (M) bit is set to ‘1’ in the Status field for the completion queue entry associated with the command
that completed with error or as part of an asynchronous event with an Error status type. This log page is
global to the controller.
This error log may return the last n errors. If the host specifies a data transfer of the size of n error logs,
then the error logs for the most recent n errors are returned. The ordering of the entries is based on the
time when the error occurred, with the most recent error being returned as the first log entry.
Each entry in the log page returned is defined in Figure 209. The log page is a set of 64-byte entries; the
maximum number of entries supported is indicated in the ELPE field in the Identify Controller data structure
(refer to Figure 328). If the log page is full when a new entry is generated, the controller should insert the
new entry into the log and discard the oldest entry.
The controller should clear this log page by removing all entries on power cycle and Controller Level Reset.
