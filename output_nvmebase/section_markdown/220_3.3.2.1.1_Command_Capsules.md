###### 3.3.2.1.1 Command Capsules

> **Section ID**: 3.3.2.1.1 | **Page**: 115-115

A command capsule is sent from a host to a controller. It contains a submission queue entry (SQE) and
may optionally contain data or SGLs. The SQE is 64 bytes in size and contains the Admin command, I/O
command, or Fabrics command to be executed.
The Command Identifier field in the SQE shall be unique among all outstanding commands associated with
that queue. If there is data or additional SGLs to be transferred within the capsule, then the SGL descriptor
in the SQE contains a Data Block, Segment Descriptor, or Last Segment Descriptor specifying an
appropriate Offset address. The definition for the submission queue entry when the command is a Fabrics
command is shown in section 4.1.2. The definition for the submission queue entry when the command is
an Admin command or I/O command is shown in section 4.1.1. Bytes 03:00 share a common format across
commands.
