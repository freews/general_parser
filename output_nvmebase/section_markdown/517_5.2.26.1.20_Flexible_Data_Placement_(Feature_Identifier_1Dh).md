###### 5.2.26.1.20 Flexible Data Placement (Feature Identifier 1Dh)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.20 | **Page**: 442-442

This Feature controls operation of the Flexible Data Placement capability (refer to section 8.1.11) in the
specified Endurance Group (refer to Figure 434).
The attribute is specified in Command Dword 12. Effects of enabling and disabling the Flexible Data
Placement are described in section 8.1.11.
If a Get Features command specifying this Feature is successfully completed, then the attributes described
in Figure 435 are returned in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.
This Feature shall be saveable (refer to section 4.4). The default value of this Feature shall be 0h.
The value of this Feature is only allowed to change if the SV bit is set to ‘1’ in the Set Features command.
Therefore, if the Save and Select Feature Support (SSFS) bit is set to ‘1’ in the ONCS field in the Identify
Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328) and the SV bit is cleared to ’0’, then the controller shall abort
the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.
If the value of this Feature changes, then the controller is allowed to modify any fields associated with
specifying any User Data Format information accessible using the Identify command (i.e., any field
associated with the Format Index (refer to section 1.6.2) that includes CNS values 00h, 05h, 08h, 09h,
0Ah). The host should issue Identify commands in this condition to access the values that may have been
modified.
