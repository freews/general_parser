###### 3.1.3.3.2 Discovery Controller Asynchronous Event Information – Requests and Notifications

> **Section ID**: 3.1.3.3.2 | **Page**: 67-68

If a Discovery controller detects an event that changes the information reported by the Discovery log page
or the Host Discovery log page about which a host has requested notification, then the Discovery controller
shall send an Asynchronous Event with the:
•
Asynchronous Event Type field set to Notice (i.e., 2h);
•
Log Page Identifier field set to either Discovery (i.e., 70h) or Host Discovery (i.e., 71h) depending
on which log page has changed; and
•
Asynchronous Event Information field set as defined in Figure 154.
As a result of a Discovery controller updating Discovery log page(s), that Discovery controller shall send a
Discovery Log Page Change Asynchronous Event notification (i.e., the Asynchronous Event Information
field set to F0h) to each entity that has requested asynchronous event notifications of this type (refer to
Figure 154).
As a result of a Discovery controller updating Host Discovery log page(s), that Discovery controller shall
send a Host Discovery Log Page Change Asynchronous Event notification (i.e., the Asynchronous Event
Information field set to F1h) to each entity that has requested asynchronous event notifications of this type
(refer to Figure 154).
