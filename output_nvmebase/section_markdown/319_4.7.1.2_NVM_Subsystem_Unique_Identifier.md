##### 4.7.1.2 NVM Subsystem Unique Identifier

> **Section ID**: 4.7.1.2 | **Page**: 192-193

The NVM Subsystem NVMe Qualified Name specified in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to
Figure 328) should be used (e.g., by a host) as the unique identifier for the NVM subsystem. If the controller
is compliant with an NVM Express Specification prior to revision 1.2.1 (i.e., revisions where the NVM
Subsystem NQN was not defined), then the PCI Vendor ID, Serial Number, and Model Number fields in the
Identify Controller data structure and the NQN Starting String “nqn.2014.08.org.nvmexpress:” may be
combined by the host to form a globally unique value that identifies the NVM subsystem (e.g., for a host
that uses NQNs). The method shown in Figure 140 should be used by the host to construct an NVM
Subsystem NQN for older NVM subsystems that do not provide an NQN in the Identify Controller data
structure. The mechanism used by the vendor to assign Serial Number and Model Number values to ensure
uniqueness is outside the scope of this specification.
