##### 3.1.4.14 Offset 44h: BPRSEL – Boot Partition Read Select

> **Section ID**: 3.1.4.14 | **Page**: 92-92

This optional property is used to initiate the transfer of a data in the Boot Partition (refer to section 8.1.3)
from the controller to the host. If the controller does not support the Boot Partitions feature, then this property
shall be cleared to 0h.
If the host attempts to read beyond the end of a Boot Partition (i.e., the Boot Partition Read Offset plus Boot
Partition Read Size, is greater than the Boot Partition Size in bytes), the controller shall not transfer data
and report an error in the BPINFO.BRS field.
