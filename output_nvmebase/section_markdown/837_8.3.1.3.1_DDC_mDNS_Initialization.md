###### 8.3.1.3.1 DDC mDNS Initialization

> **Section ID**: 8.3.1.3.1 | **Page**: 701-701

During initialization (e.g., following a link transition or power cycle), before the DDC’s mDNS responder
function is enabled, the DDC shall probe to ensure the unique resource records the DDC are responsible
for are unique on the local link (refer to section 8.1 in RFC 6762).
Upon successful completion of the probe, the DDC shall Announce (refer to section 8.2 in RFC 6762) its
newly registered resource records.
Upon announcing its resource records, if a DDC:
a. has not been configured to perform push registration (refer to section 8.3.2.2.1), or has not been
configured to request a pull registration (refer to section 8.3.2.2.2) from a CDC, it may respond to
mDNS queries for the service name of “_nvme-disc.<protocol>.local”; or
b. has been configured to perform push registration (refer to section 8.3.2.2.1) with a CDC, it should
not respond to mDNS queries for the service name of “_nvme-disc.<protocol>.local”, unless it has
been administratively configured to do so or until it has performed a query and determined a CDC
is not present as defined in section 8.3.1.3.3.
