###### 5.2.12.1.25 Reachability Groups (Log Identifier 1Ah)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.25 | **Page**: 300-301

This log page consists of a header describing the log page and a list of descriptors containing the
Reachability Groups (refer to section 8.1.21) that contain namespaces attached to the controller processing
this command that all have the same reachability attributes.
If the Index Offset Supported bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the LID Support and Effects data structure for this log
page (refer to Figure 208), then:
•
if the RGO bit is cleared to ‘0’ in Command Dword 10, then the LPOL field in Command Dword 12
and the LPOU field in Command Dword 13 of the Get Log Page command should be cleared to
0h.
If the Index Offset Supported bit is set to ‘1’ in the LID Supported and Effects data structure for this log page
(refer to Figure 208), then:
•
for indexes greater than 0, the entry data structure that is indexed is a Reachability Group descriptor
(e.g., specifying an index offset of 2 returns this log page starting at the second descriptor (i.e.,
Reachability Group Descriptor 1)); and
•
for index 0, the data structure starting from the beginning of the log page is returned.
If the host performs multiple Get Log Page commands to read this log page (e.g., using the LPOL field or
the LPOU field), then the host should re-read the header of the log page and ensure that the Change Count
field in the log page matches the original value read. If it does not match, then the data captured is not
consistent and this log page should be re-read.
The Log Specific Parameter field in Command Dword 10 (refer to Figure 201) for this log page is defined
in Figure 278.
The format of the Reachability Group Descriptor is defined in Figure 280. Namespace Identifiers shall be
listed in ascending NSID order.

| Bits | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 14:09 | Reserved |
| 08 | Return Groups Only (RGO): If this bit is set to '1', then the controller shall return Reachability Group Descriptors with the Number of NSID Values field in each Reachability Group Descriptor cleared to 0h (i.e., no Namespace Identifiers are returned). If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller shall return Reachability Group Descriptors that contain the Namespace Identifiers of attached namespaces that are members of the Reachability Group described by the Reachability Group Descriptor and the Number of NSID Values field set to the number of Namespace Identifier values in that Reachability Group Descriptor. |

| | **Header** |
| 07:00 | Change Count (CHNGC): This field contains a 64-bit incrementing Reachability Groups log page change count, indicating an identifier for this set of reachability groups information. The count starts at 0h following a Controller Level Reset and is incremented each time the contents of the log page change. If the value of this field is FFFFFF_FFFFFFh, then the field shall be set to 0h when incremented (i.e., rolls over to 0h). |
| 09:08 | Number of Reachability Group Descriptors (NRGD): This field indicates the number of Reachability Group Descriptors available in the log page. The log page shall contain one Reachability Group Descriptor for each Reachability Group that contains namespaces that are attached to the controller.<br><br>If, for a Reachability Group, there are no namespaces attached to the controller processing the command, then no Reachability Group Descriptor is returned for that Reachability Group (i.e., a Reachability Group Descriptor is returned only if that Reachability Group contains namespaces that are attached to the controller processing the command).<br><br>If no namespaces are attached to the controller, then the log page does not contain any Reachability Group Descriptors and this field shall be cleared to 0h. |

| | **Reachability Group Descriptor List** |
| n:16 | Reachability Group Descriptor 0: The first Reachability Group Descriptor (refer to Figure 280), if any. |
| m:n+1 | Reachability Group Descriptor 1: The second Reachability Group Descriptor (refer to Figure 280), if any. |

| 03:00 | Reachability Group ID (RGID): The Reachability Group Identifier associated with namespaces in the Reachability Group (refer to section 8.1.21) described by this Reachability Group Descriptor. |
| 07:04 | Number of NSID Values (NNID): This field indicates the number of Namespace Identifier values in this Reachability Group Descriptor.<br><br>If the RGO bit is set to '1', then this field shall be cleared to 0h. |
| 15:08 | Change Count (CHNGC): This field contains a 64-bit incrementing count, indicating an identifier for the information contained in this Reachability Group Descriptor. A value of 0h indicates that the controller does not report a Change Count for this Reachability Group Descriptor. If a Change Count is reported, then the count starts at 1h following a Controller Level Reset and is incremented each time the data in this Reachability Group Descriptor changes. If the value of this field is FFFFFF_FFFFFFh, then the field shall be set to 1h when incremented (i.e., rolls over to 1h).<br><br>If this field contains 0h, the host should examine this Reachability Group Descriptor for any changes and not use this field as an indicator that a change has occurred. |
