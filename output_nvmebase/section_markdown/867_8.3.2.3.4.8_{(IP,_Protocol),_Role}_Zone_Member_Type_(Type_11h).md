###### 8.3.2.3.4.8 {(IP, Protocol), Role} Zone Member Type (Type 11h)

> **Section ID**: 8.3.2.3.4.8 | **Page**: 716-716

This Zone member type identifies the fabric interface (i.e., through the IP address) of an NVMe-oF entity
and the specific IP protocol (e.g., TCP) used by the NVMe-oF entity over that fabric interface. The format
of this Zone member type is shown in Figure 749.
