| 07:00 | Pre-boot Software Load Count (PBSLC): Indicates the load count of pre-boot software. After successfully loading and initializing the controller, pre-boot software should set this field to one more than the previous value of the Pre-boot Software Load Count. If the previous value was 255, then the value should not be updated by pre-boot software (i.e., the value does not wrap to 0). OS driver software should set this field to 0h after the OS has successfully been initialized. |
