###### 5.2.26.1.24.3 Security Personality

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.24.3 | **Page**: 450-453

The Security Personality allows a host to configure the NVM subsystem with one or more of the security
protocols supported indicated in Figure 450.
If an NVM subsystem is configured with that Security Personality and a supported security protocol has
been enabled, then any Security Send and Security Receive command issued by the host that specifies
that security protocol shall be allowed.
If a security protocol is allowed, then once the security protocol is no longer in the defined default
manufacturing state (e.g., transition out of the Manufacturing-Inactive state for the TCG Security Protocol
(refer to the TCG Storage Security Subsystem Class: Opal Specification)), then the controller shall freeze
the Security Personality and a CDP Change Event shall be recorded in the Persistent Event log page for
the Security Personality (refer to section 5.2.12.1.14.2.15).
If a supported security protocol is prohibited, then any Security Send and Security Receive command issued
by the host that specifies that security protocol shall be prohibited. If a Security Send or Security Receive
command is processed that uses a security protocol that is prohibited, then the controller shall abort the
command with a status code of Access Denied.
If a Get Features command specifies this personality, then the Security Personality data structure defined
in Figure 450 shall be returned in the data buffer for that command.
If a Set Features command is processed for the Security Personality, then the Security Personality
Attributes data structure (refer to Figure 451) is specified in the data buffer for that command. If the host
specifies a Supported Security Protocol (SSP) field value that is not supported, then the controller shall
abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.
A security protocol that is allowed shall only able to be unfrozen if that security protocol is reset to the
default security settings for the given security protocol. Refer to the appropriate security specification (e.g.,
PSID Feature Set to reset the device to Original Factory Settings (OFS) using the Revert method defined
in TCG Storage Opal SSC Feature Set: PSID Specification).
