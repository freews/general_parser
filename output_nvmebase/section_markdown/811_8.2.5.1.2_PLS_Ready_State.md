###### 8.2.5.1.2 PLS Ready State

> **Section ID**: 8.2.5.1.2 | **Page**: 689-690

In the PLS Ready state, the controller is not performing Power Loss Signaling processing and is not
performing shutdown processing. The controller enters the PLS Ready state when the CSTS.SHST field is
00b.
Transitions out of this state are defined in Figure 721. If the controller is in this state and the CSTS.RDY bit
is cleared to ‘0’, then it is implementation specific whether the controller responds to a transition of the PLN
variable from Deasserted to Asserted.
