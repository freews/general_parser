###### 5.2.26.2.1 Number of Queues (Feature Identifier 07h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.2.1 | **Page**: 467-468

This Feature indicates the number of queues that the host requests for the controller processing the
command. This Feature shall only be issued during initialization prior to creation of any I/O Submission
and/or Completion Queues. If a Set Features command is issued for this Feature after creation of any I/O
Submission and/or I/O Completion Queues, then the Set Features command shall abort with status code
of Command Sequence Error. The controller shall not change the value allocated between resets. For a
Set Features command, the attributes are specified in Command Dword 11 (refer to Figure 472). For a Get
Features command, Dword 11 is ignored.
If a Set Features or Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure
473 are returned in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.
Note: The value allocated may be smaller or larger than the number of queues requested, often in virtualized
implementations. The controller may not have as many queues to allocate as are requested. Alternatively,
the controller may have an allocation unit of queues (e.g., power of two) and may supply more queues to
the host to satisfy its allocation unit.
