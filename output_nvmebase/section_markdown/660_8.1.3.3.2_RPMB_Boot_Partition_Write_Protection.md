###### 8.1.3.3.2 RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection

> **Section ID**: 8.1.3.3.2 | **Page**: 551-553

Figure 626 shows an overview of the Boot Partition write protection states for each Boot Partition when only
RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection is supported.
If Set Features Boot Partition Write Protection is not supported by the controller, then prior to enabling
RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection, the default state for all Boot Partitions is the Write Unlocked state. If
Set Features Boot Partition Write Protection is also supported by the controller, then the default state for
all Boot Partitions is the Write Locked state, regardless of whether RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection
has been enabled or not. Refer to section 8.1.3.3.1 for more details on Boot Partition write protection when
RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection is disabled and section 8.1.3.3.3 for additional considerations when
both Boot Partition write protection capabilities are supported.
If Set Features Boot Partition Write Protection is not supported by the controller, then all Boot Partitions
remain unlocked until RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection is enabled by the host. A host enables RPMB
Boot Partition Write Protection by setting the Boot Partition Write Protection Enabled bit in the RPMB Device
Configuration Block data structure (refer to section 8.1.23). Once RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection is
enabled, the controller shall reject Authenticated Device Configuration Block Writes that attempt to disable
the RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection mechanism (i.e., enabling RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection
is permanent). Once RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection is enabled, Boot Partitions are able to be
modified only after write unlocking the Boot Partition using RPMB.
After enabling RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection:
c) The default state for all Boot Partitions is the Write Locked state. In this state, a host may read a
Boot Partition. In this state, the controller rejects attempts to write to a Boot Partition using the
Firmware Commit command;
d) Each Boot Partition may be locked or unlocked independently using the corresponding bit in the
Device Configuration Block data structure. A Boot Partition may be unlocked in the same command
that enables RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection; and
e) If any Boot Partition has been unlocked, a power cycle or Controller Level Reset event results in
that Boot Partition becoming write locked.
