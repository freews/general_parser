###### 5.2.12.1.33 Power Measurement (Log Page Identifier 25h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.33 | **Page**: 313-317

The Power Measurement log page (refer to Figure 297) is used for the reporting of logged interval power
measurements for the Power Measurement capability, including:
•
the average of the interval power measurements;
•
the maximum interval power measurement; and
•
a histogram of the interval power measurements.
The information in this log page shall be retained across power cycles and resets.
This log page is global to the NVM subsystem.
Refer to section 8.1.19.1 for the usage of this log page by the host.
The Power Histogram Descriptor is defined in Figure 298. In this log page, the Power Histogram Descriptors
shall be listed in ascending order based on the power indicated by the Power Histogram Bin Lower
Threshold (PHBLT) field.
If:
•
the Power Measurement Count (PMC) field is set to a non-zero value at the time this log page is
read; and
•
the Number of Power Histogram Descriptors Supported (NPHDS) field is set to a non-zero value,
then
•
the first Power Histogram Descriptor (i.e., Power Histogram Descriptor 0) shall have the Power
Histogram Bin Lower Threshold (PHBLT) field set to 0 Watts;
•
the last Power Histogram Descriptor (i.e., Power Histogram Descriptor NPHD-1) shall contain the
highest power in the PHBLT field with a non-zero value in the Power Histogram Bin Count (PHBC)
field; and
•
there shall be no gaps in the power ranges in the set of Power Histogram Descriptors returned (i.e.
Power Histogram Descriptors with non-zero values in PHBC field are not packed together).
If the Power Measurement Count (PMC) field is cleared to 0h at the time this log page is read, then the
Number of Power Histogram Descriptors (NPHD) field shall be cleared to 0h.
