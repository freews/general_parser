#### 8.1.22 Read Recovery Level

> **Section ID**: 8.1.22 | **Page**: 632-633

The Read Recovery Level (RRL) is an NVM Set configurable attribute that balances the completion time
for read commands and the amount of error recovery applied to those read commands. The Read Recovery
Level applies to an NVM Set with which the Read Recovery Level is associated. A namespace created
within an NVM Set inherits the Read Recovery Level of that NVM Set. If NVM Sets are not supported, all
namespaces in the NVM subsystem use an identical Read Recovery Level.
The controller indicates support for Read Recovery Levels in the Controller Attributes field in the Identify
Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328). If Read Recovery Levels are supported, then the specific
levels supported are indicated in the Read Recovery Levels Supported field in the Identify Controller data
structure. There are 16 levels that may be supported. Level 0, if supported, provides the maximum amount
of recovery. Level 4 is a mandatory level that provides a nominal amount of recovery and is the default
level. Level 15 is a mandatory level that provides the minimum amount of recovery and is referred to as the
‘Fast Fail’ level. The levels are organized based on the amount of recovery supported, such that a higher
numbered level provides less recovery than the preceding lower level.
Interactions between the Read Recovery Level and the Limited Retry (LR) field in I/O commands are
implementation specific.
The Read Recovery Level may be configured using a Set Features command for the Read Recovery Level
Config Feature. The Read Recovery Level may be determined using a Get Features command for the Read
Recovery Level Config Feature.
If Read Recovery Levels are supported, then the NVM subsystem and all controllers shall:
•
Support at least Level 4 and Level 15;
•
Indicate support for Read Recovery Levels in the Controller Attributes field in the Identify Controller
data structure;
•
Support the Read Recovery Levels Supported field in the Identify Controller data structure; and
•
Support the Read Recovery Level Config Feature.
