### 1.2 Scope

> **Section ID**: 1.2 | **Page**: 26-26

This specification defines a set of properties and commands that comprise the interface required for
communication with a controller in an NVM subsystem. These properties are to be implemented by an
instance of a controller using a specific NVMe Transport. This specification also defines common aspects
of the NVMe I/O Command Sets that may be supported by a controller.
There are three types of controllers with different capabilities (refer to section 3.1.3):
a) I/O controllers;
b) Discovery controllers; and
c) Administrative controllers.
In this document the generic term controller is often used instead of enumerating specific controller types
when applicable controller types may be determined from the context.
