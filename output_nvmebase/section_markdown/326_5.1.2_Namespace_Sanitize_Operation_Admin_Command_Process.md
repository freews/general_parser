#### 5.1.2 Namespace Sanitize Operation Admin Command Processing Restrictions

> **Section ID**: 5.1.2 | **Page**: 198-200

Figure 144 lists Admin commands that have processing restrictions while a namespace sanitize operation
is in progress.
If an Admin command is being processed that either:
•
affects (e.g., changes or deletes) a namespace that is the sanitization target of an in progress
namespace sanitize operation (e.g., a command that affects all namespaces or a command with
an NSID set to the NSID of a namespace which is being sanitized); or
•
causes the user data to be accessed (e.g., read) for a namespace that is the sanitization target of
an in progress namespace sanitize operation,
then that command shall be aborted with a status code of Sanitize Namespace In Progress.
Some Admin commands only affect attached namespaces while other Admin commands are capable of
affecting namespaces that are not attached. Figure 144 describes Admin command processing restrictions
for all controllers while any namespace is a sanitization target of an in progress namespace sanitize
operation. Figure 145 describes Admin command processing restrictions for controllers with an attached
namespace that is a sanitization target of an in progress namespace sanitize operation. Admin commands
not shown in Figure 144 or Figure 145 (e.g., Vendor Specific commands) are aborted with a status code of
Sanitize Namespace In Progress if the implementation of that Admin command affects a namespace which
is a sanitization target of an in progress namespace sanitize operation.
