###### 5.2.12.1.14.2.11 Set Feature Event (Event Type 0Bh)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.14.2.11 | **Page**: 278-280

The Set Feature Event persists the data of a successful Set Features command. The event contains a
Persistent Event Log Event header and the Set Feature Event data (refer to Figure 250).
The Set Feature Event shall set the Persistent Event Log Event Header:
•
Event Type field to 0Bh; and
•
Event Type Revision Field to 01h.
A Set Feature Event shall be recorded in the Persistent Event Log when the following criteria are met:
•
A Set Features command completes successfully;
•
The Feature Identifier in that Set Features command is supported to be logged in the Persistent
Event Log; and
•
There is a change to the controller settings for the Feature Identifier in that Set Features command
(i.e., the same setting is not set again).
A Set Feature Event may be recorded in the Persistent Event Log when there is no change to the controller
settings for the Feature Identifier in that Set Features command if the following criteria are met:
•
A Set Features command completes successfully; and
•
The Feature Identifier in that Set Features command is supported to be logged in the Persistent
Event Log.
The Feature Identifiers that may be supported to be logged in the Persistent Event Log are shown in Figure
249.
The Command Dwords and data buffer logged in the Set Feature Event data use the same formats as the
formats defined by the Set Features and Get Features commands.
