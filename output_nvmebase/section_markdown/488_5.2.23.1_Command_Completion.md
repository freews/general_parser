##### 5.2.23.1 Command Completion

> **Section ID**: 5.2.23.1 | **Page**: 419-420

When the command is complete, the controller shall post a completion queue entry to the Admin Completion
Queue indicating the status for the command. All namespace sanitize operations are performed in the
background (i.e., completion of the Sanitize Namespace command that started that namespace sanitize
operation does not indicate completion of the namespace sanitize operation). If a namespace sanitize
operation starts (refer to section 8.1.26.4), then the Sanitize Status log page for the sanitization target shall
be updated before posting the completion queue entry for the command that started that namespace
sanitize operation.
Sanitize Namespace command specific status values (i.e., SCT field set to 1h) are shown in Figure 392.
