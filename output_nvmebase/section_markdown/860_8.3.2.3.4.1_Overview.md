Zone members are represented as type-length-value (TLV) data structures. Figure 742 shows the defined
Zone member types. If a Zone member type does not include a particular element in the pairing for that
Zone member type, then the element values of that type shall not be used for enforcement of Zoning
restrictions for that Zone (e.g., Zone member type 1h does not include IP addresses in the enforcement of
that Zone member type).
The members of a Zone may communicate with each other using the following rules:
•
hosts may communicate with NVM subsystems;
•
NVM subsystems may communicate with hosts;
•
hosts shall not communicate with hosts; and
•
NVM subsystems shall not communicate with NVM subsystems.
A Zone of a ZoneGroup belonging to the ZoneDBConfig may use all defined Zone member types. When a
ZoneGroup belonging to the ZoneDBConfig is activated and becomes part of the ZoneDBActive, all
ZoneAlias name Zone members are resolved in the group of NVMe entities referenced by the ZoneAlias
name.
