#### 5.3.6 Virtualization Management command

> **Section ID**: 5.3.6 | **Page**: 486-487

The Virtualization Management command is supported by primary controllers that support the Virtualization
Enhancements capability. This command is used for several functions:
•
Modifying Flexible Resource allocation for the primary controller;
•
Assigning Flexible Resources for secondary controllers; and
•
Setting the Online and Offline state for secondary controllers.
Refer to section 8.2.6 for more on the Virtualization Enhancements capability and the Virtualization
Management command.
The Virtualization Management command uses the Command Dword 10 and Command Dword 11 fields.
All other command specific fields are reserved.
If the action requested specifies a range of controller resources that:
a) does not exist;
b) is a Private Resource (e.g., VQ resources are requested when VQ resources are not supported, VI
resources are requested when VI resources are not supported); or
c) is currently in use (e.g., the number of Controller Resources (NR) is greater than the number of
remaining available flexible resources),
then the command is aborted with a status code of Invalid Resource Identifier.
