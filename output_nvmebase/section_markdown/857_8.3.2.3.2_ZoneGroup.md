###### 8.3.2.3.2 ZoneGroup

> **Section ID**: 8.3.2.3.2 | **Page**: 710-711

A ZoneGroup is the unit of activation (i.e., a set of access control rules enforceable by the CDC). The
detailed representation of a ZoneGroup is shown in Figure 740.
A ZoneGroup is uniquely identified by the pair {ZoneGroup Name, ZoneGroup Originator}. For each
ZoneGroup, the CDC shall maintain:
•
a unique ZoneGroup key, used as a compact ZoneGroup identifier in the FZS and FZR commands
(refer to sections 5.4.7 and 5.4.6 respectively). ZoneGroup keys should not be reused; and
•
a generation number, incremented each time a ZoneGroup is updated and used by the GAZ
operation (refer to section 8.3.2.3.8.2). If the value of the generation number is FFFFFFFFh, then
the generation number shall be set to 1h when incremented (i.e., rolls over to 1h).
