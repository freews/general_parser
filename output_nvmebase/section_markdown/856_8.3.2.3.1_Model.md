A Centralized Discovery controller (CDC) may provide centralized access control services (i.e., Fabric
Zoning) for an NVMe-oF IP-based fabric. CDC-based Fabric Zoning provides a way to control the Discovery
log pages provided in response to a Get Log Page command issued to the CDC. Fabric Zoning should be
based on a Zoning database maintained by the CDC and containing two fundamental data structures: the
ZoneDBConfig and the ZoneDBActive, as shown in Figure 737.
The ZoneDBActive is a list of enforced ZoneGroups. The enforcement actions include:
•
Discovery log page filtering;
•
Discovery Log Page Change Asynchronous Event notifications (refer to section 8.3.2.4); and
•
optionally, network level restrictions (refer to section 8.3.2.3.5.2).
The abstract representation of the ZoneDBActive is shown in Figure 738.
The ZoneDBConfig is a list of configured ZoneGroups and ZoneAliases, as shown in Figure 739.
