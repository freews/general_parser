###### 5.2.26.1.22 Namespace Admin Label (Feature Identifier 1Fh)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.22 | **Page**: 444-445

The Namespace Admin Label feature provides the ability to set and get the Namespace Admin Label for a
namespace. This Feature shall be saveable and therefore shall not be supported if the Save and Select
Feature Support (SSFS) bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the Optional NVM Command Support (ONCS) field of the
Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328). The attributes in Figure 442 are transferred in the
data buffer.
The saved value and current value of this Feature shall be identical. If the SV bit is cleared to ‘0’ in a Set
Features command that specifies this Feature, the controller shall abort the command with a status code
of Invalid Field in the Command. If the value of the Namespace Admin Label is changed by means outside
the scope of this standard, then that change shall affect the results of any subsequent Get Features
command that specifies this Feature.
The default value of this Feature is all nulls (i.e., all bytes cleared to 0h). Sanitize operations (refer to section
8.1.26) affect the values of this Feature; any successful sanitize operation shall modify this Feature by
resetting both the saved value and the current value to the default value (refer to Figure 704).
If a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure 442 are returned
in the data buffer for that command.
