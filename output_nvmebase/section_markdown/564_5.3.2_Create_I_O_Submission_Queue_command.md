#### 5.3.2 Create I/O Submission Queue command

> **Section ID**: 5.3.2 | **Page**: 482-483

The Create I/O Submission Queue command is used to create I/O Submission Queues. The Admin
Submission Queue is created by specifying its base address in the ASQ property. If a PRP List is provided
to describe the SQ to be created, then the PRP List shall be maintained by a host at the same location in
host physical memory and the values in the PRP List shall not be modified until the corresponding Delete
I/O Submission Queue command for that SQ is completed or the controller is reset. If the PRP List values
are modified, the behavior is undefined.
The Create I/O Submission Queue command uses the PRP Entry 1, Command Dword 10, Command
Dword 11, and Command Dword 12 fields. All other command specific fields are reserved.
