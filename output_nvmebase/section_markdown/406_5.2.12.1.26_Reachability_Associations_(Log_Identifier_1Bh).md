###### 5.2.12.1.26 Reachability Associations (Log Identifier 1Bh)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.26 | **Page**: 301-303

This log page consists of a header describing the log page and a list of descriptors containing the
Reachability Associations (refer to section 8.1.21), for the controller processing the Get Log Page command
requesting the Reachability Associations log page, that contain Reachability Groups (refer 5.2.12.1.25) that
all have the same reachability attributes.
If the Index Offset Supported bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the LID Support and Effects data structure for this log
page (refer to Figure 208), then:
•
if the RAO bit is cleared to ‘0’ in Command Dword 10, then the LPOL field in Command Dword 12
and the LPOU field in Command Dword 13 of the Get Log Page command should be cleared to
0h.
If the Index Offset Supported bit is set to ‘1’ in the LID Supported and Effects data structure for this log page
(refer to Figure 208), then:
•
for indexes greater than 0, the entry data structure that is indexed is a Reachability Association
descriptor (e.g., specifying an index offset of 2 returns this log page starting at the second descriptor
(i.e., Reachability Association Descriptor 1)).
If the host performs multiple Get Log Page commands to read this log page (e.g., using the LPOL field or
the LPOU field), then the host should re-read the header of the log page and ensure that the Change Count
field in this log page matches the original value read. If it does not match, then the data captured is not
consistent and this log page should be re-read.
The Log Specific Parameter field in Command Dword 10 (refer to Figure 201) for this log page is defined
in Figure 281.

| Bits | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 14:09 | Reserved |
| 08 | Return Associations Only (RAO): If this bit is set to '1', then the controller shall return Reachability Association Descriptors with the Number of RGID Values field in each Reachability Association Descriptor cleared to 0h (i.e., no Reachability Group Identifiers are returned). If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller shall return Reachability Association Descriptors that contain the RGIDs of reachability groups that are members of the Reachability Association described by that Reachability Association Descriptor and the Number of RGID Values field set to the number of Reachability Group Identifier values in that Reachability Association Descriptor. |

| | **Header** |
| 07:00 | **Change Count (CHNGC):** This field contains a 64-bit incrementing Reachability Associations log change count, indicating an identifier for this set of reachability associations information. The count starts at 0h following a Controller Level Reset and is incremented each time the contents of the log page change. If the value of this field is FFFFFFFF_FFFFFFh, then the field shall be set to 0h when incremented, (i.e., rolls over to 0h). |
| 09:08 | **Number of Reachability Association Descriptors (NRAD):** This field indicates the number of Reachability Association Descriptors available in the log page. The log page shall contain one Reachability Association Descriptor for each Reachability Association that contains a Reachability Group that contains namespaces that are attached to the controller. <br> If, for a Reachability Association, there are no Reachability Groups that contains namespaces that are attached to the controller processing the command, then no Reachability Descriptor shall be returned for that Reachability Association (i.e., a Reachability Association Descriptor is returned only if that Reachability Association contains Reachability Groups associated with the controller processing the command). <br> If no namespaces are attached to the controller, then the log page does not contain any Reachability Association Descriptors and this field shall be cleared to 0h. |
| 15:10 | Reserved |
| | **Reachability Association Descriptor List** |
| n:16 | **Reachability Association Descriptor 0:** This is the first Reachability Association Descriptor (Figure 283), if any. |
| m:n+1 | **Reachability Association Descriptor 1:** This is the second Reachability Association Descriptor (Figure 283), if any. |
| ... | ... |
| x:y | **Reachability Association Descriptor NRAD-1:** This is the last Reachability Association Descriptor (Figure 283), if any. |

| | **Header** |
| 03:00 | **Reachability Association ID (RASID):** The Reachability Association Identifier associated with Reachability Groups in the Reachability Association (refer to section 8.1.21) described by this Reachability Association Descriptor. |
| 07:04 | **Number of RGID VALUES (NRID):** This field indicates the number of Reachability Group Identifier values in this Reachability Association Descriptor. <br> If the RAO bit is set to '1', then this field shall be cleared to 0h. |
| 15:08 | **Change Count (CHNGC):** This field contains a 64-bit incrementing count, indicating an identifier for the information contained in this Reachability Association Descriptor. A value of 0h indicates that the controller does not report a Change Count for this Reachability Association Descriptor. If a Change Count is reported, then the count starts at 1h following a Controller Level Reset and is incremented each time the data in this Reachability Association Descriptor changes. If the value of this field is FFFFFFFF_FFFFFFh, then the field shall be set to 1h when incremented (i.e., rolls over to 1h). <br> If this field is cleared to 0h, then the host should examine this Reachability Association Descriptor for any changes and not use this field as an indicator that a change has occurred. |
| 16 | **Reachability Association Characteristics (RAC):** This field indicates the Access characteristics for all Reachability Groups in this Reachability Association Descriptor for operations between the namespaces represented by the Reachability Groups. |

| 35:32 | **Reachability Group Identifier 0:** The Reachability Group Identifier of the first Reachability Group, if any, that is a member of this Reachability Association. |

| ... | ... |
| ((NRID-1)\*4)+35: ((NRID-1)\*4)+32 | **Reachability Group Identifier NRID-1:** The Reachability Group Identifier of the last Reachability Group, if any, that is a member of this Reachability Association. |
