###### 5.2.12.1.26 Reachability Associations (Log Identifier 1Bh)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.26 | **Page**: 301-303

This log page consists of a header describing the log page and a list of descriptors containing the
Reachability Associations (refer to section 8.1.21), for the controller processing the Get Log Page command
requesting the Reachability Associations log page, that contain Reachability Groups (refer 5.2.12.1.25) that
all have the same reachability attributes.
If the Index Offset Supported bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the LID Support and Effects data structure for this log
page (refer to Figure 208), then:
•
if the RAO bit is cleared to ‘0’ in Command Dword 10, then the LPOL field in Command Dword 12
and the LPOU field in Command Dword 13 of the Get Log Page command should be cleared to
0h.
If the Index Offset Supported bit is set to ‘1’ in the LID Supported and Effects data structure for this log page
(refer to Figure 208), then:
•
for indexes greater than 0, the entry data structure that is indexed is a Reachability Association
descriptor (e.g., specifying an index offset of 2 returns this log page starting at the second descriptor
(i.e., Reachability Association Descriptor 1)).
If the host performs multiple Get Log Page commands to read this log page (e.g., using the LPOL field or
the LPOU field), then the host should re-read the header of the log page and ensure that the Change Count
field in this log page matches the original value read. If it does not match, then the data captured is not
consistent and this log page should be re-read.
The Log Specific Parameter field in Command Dword 10 (refer to Figure 201) for this log page is defined
in Figure 281.
