###### 8.1.26.3.1 Sanitize NVM Subsystem Failure Handling

> **Section ID**: 8.1.26.3.1 | **Page**: 661-661

If an NVM subsystem sanitize operation fails (i.e., the sanitization target enters the Restricted Failure state
or the Unrestricted Failure state), all controllers in the NVM subsystem shall abort any command not allowed
during an NVM subsystem sanitize operation with a status code of Sanitize Failed (refer to section 8.1.26.4)
until a subsequent NVM subsystem sanitize operation is started or successful recovery from the failed NVM
subsystem sanitize operation occurs. A subsequent successful NVM subsystem sanitize operation or the
Exit Failure Mode action may be used to recover from a failed NVM subsystem sanitize operation. Refer to
section 5.2.22 for recovery details.
