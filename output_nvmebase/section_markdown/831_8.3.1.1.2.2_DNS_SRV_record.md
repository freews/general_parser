###### 8.3.1.1.2.2 DNS SRV record

> **Section ID**: 8.3.1.1.2.2 | **Page**: 700-700

The DNS SRV record provides the TCP port where the service instance can be reached and shall have a
name in the form of:
“<Instance>.<Service>.<Domain>”.
Instance (Instance name) is a vendor defined human readable string. Although use of a serial number is
discouraged in DNS-Based Service Discovery (refer to RFC 6763), an instance name that may be
meaningful to an IT administrator is a combination of the Model Number (MN), Serial Number (SN) and
Physical Fabric Interface (Physical Ports). For example:
“SubsystemIF-SerialNumber-SubsystemModel”.
The maximum length of the Instance Name field is 63 bytes (refer to RFC 6763).
The <Service> portion of the name (refer to section 4.1 of RFC 6763) can be further broken down into:
“<service name>.<protocol>”.
