##### 8.1.21.2 Reachability event notifications

> **Section ID**: 8.1.21.2 | **Page**: 631-632

Reachability may generate a Reachability Group Change notice (refer to section 5.2.2.1) or a Reachability
Association Change notice (refer to section 5.2.2.1).
Receipt of a Reachability Group Change Notice from a controller may indicate:
a) an NSID has been added to one or more of the Reachability Group Descriptors;
b) an NSID has been removed from one or more of the Reachability Group Descriptors;
c) a Reachability Group no longer has any NSIDs attached to this controller as members of that
Reachability Group and therefore is no longer reported in the Reachability Groups log page for this
controller; or
d) the NSID of a namespace has moved from one Reachability Group Descriptor to a different
Reachability Group Descriptor (i.e., the RGRPID field in the I/O Command Set Independent Identify
Namespace Data Structure for that namespace has changed), if RGIDC bit in the CRCAP field is
cleared to ‘0’ in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328).
As a result of receiving a Reachability Group Change notice, the host should read the Reachability Groups
log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.25) to check for each of those possible changes.
Receipt of a Reachability Association Change Notice from a controller may indicate:
a) an RGID has been added to one or more of the Reachability Association Descriptors;
b) an RGID has been removed from one or more of the Reachability Association Descriptors; and/or
c) a Reachability Association no longer has any RGIDs associated with this controller as members of
that Reachability Association and therefore is no longer reported in the Reachability Associations
log page for this controller.
As a result of receiving a Reachability Association Change notice, the host should read the Reachability
Associations log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.26) to check for each of those possible changes.
