##### 8.1.2.3 Host ANA Persistent Loss Operation

> **Section ID**: 8.1.2.3 | **Page**: 546-546

If the ANA log page reports an ANA state of ANA Persistent Loss State for an ANA Group or a command
returns a status code of Asymmetric Access Persistent Loss, then the host should not use that controller to
send commands to any namespace in that ANA Group, and select a different controller for sending
commands to any namespace in that ANA Group. If the controller supports the Namespace Management
capability (refer to section 8.1.16), then the namespaces in an ANA Group reporting this state should be
detached.
