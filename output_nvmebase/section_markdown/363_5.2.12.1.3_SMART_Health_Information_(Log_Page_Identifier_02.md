###### 5.2.12.1.3 SMART / Health Information (Log Page Identifier 02h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.3 | **Page**: 237-242

This log page is used to provide SMART and general health information. The information provided is over
the life of the controller and is retained across power cycles unless otherwise specified. To request the
controller log page, the namespace identifier specified is FFFFFFFFh or 0h. For compatibility with
implementations compliant with NVM Express Base Specification, Revision 1.4 and earlier, hosts should
use a namespace identifier of FFFFFFFFh to request the controller log page. The controller may also
support requesting the log page on a per namespace basis, as indicated by the SMART Support bit of the
LPA field in the Identify Controller data structure in Figure 328.
If the log page is not supported on a per namespace basis and:
•
if a namespace identifier other than 0h or FFFFFFFFh is specified by the host, then the controller
shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command; and
•
if a namespace identifier of 0h or FFFFFFFFh is specified by the host, then the controller returns
the controller log page.
There is no namespace specific information defined in the SMART / Health Information log page in this
revision of the specification, thus the controller log page and namespaces specific log page contain identical
information.
Critical warnings regarding the health of the NVM subsystem may be indicated via an asynchronous event
notification to the host. The warnings that result in an asynchronous event notification to the host are
configured using the Set Features command; refer to section 5.2.26.1.5.
Performance may be calculated using parameters returned as part of the SMART / Health Information log.
Specifically, the number of Read or Write commands, the amount of data read or written, and the amount
of controller busy time enables both I/Os per second and bandwidth to be calculated.
The log page returned is defined in Figure 210.
