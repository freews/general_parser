###### 5.2.12.1.3 SMART / Health Information (Log Page Identifier 02h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.3 | **Page**: 237-242

This log page is used to provide SMART and general health information. The information provided is over
the life of the controller and is retained across power cycles unless otherwise specified. To request the
controller log page, the namespace identifier specified is FFFFFFFFh or 0h. For compatibility with
implementations compliant with NVM Express Base Specification, Revision 1.4 and earlier, hosts should
use a namespace identifier of FFFFFFFFh to request the controller log page. The controller may also
support requesting the log page on a per namespace basis, as indicated by the SMART Support bit of the
LPA field in the Identify Controller data structure in Figure 328.
If the log page is not supported on a per namespace basis and:
•
if a namespace identifier other than 0h or FFFFFFFFh is specified by the host, then the controller
shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command; and
•
if a namespace identifier of 0h or FFFFFFFFh is specified by the host, then the controller returns
the controller log page.
There is no namespace specific information defined in the SMART / Health Information log page in this
revision of the specification, thus the controller log page and namespaces specific log page contain identical
information.
Critical warnings regarding the health of the NVM subsystem may be indicated via an asynchronous event
notification to the host. The warnings that result in an asynchronous event notification to the host are
configured using the Set Features command; refer to section 5.2.26.1.5.
Performance may be calculated using parameters returned as part of the SMART / Health Information log.
Specifically, the number of Read or Write commands, the amount of data read or written, and the amount
of controller busy time enables both I/Os per second and bandwidth to be calculated.
The log page returned is defined in Figure 210.

| Bytes | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| | **Critical Warning (CW):** This field indicates critical warnings for the state of the controller. Each bit corresponds to a critical warning type; multiple bits may be set to '1'. If a bit is cleared to '0', then that critical warning does not apply. Critical warnings may result in an asynchronous event notification to the host. Bits in this field represent the state at the time the Get Log Page command is processed or may not reflect the state at the time a related asynchronous event notification, if any, occurs or occurred. |
| | |
| 00 | **Bits**<br>**Description** |
| | 7<br>Reserved |
| | 6<br>Indeterminate Personality State (IPS): If this bit is set to '1', then a requested change to the settings of a personality did not complete successfully and the controller was not able to revert to the previous personality. As a result, the settings in the NVM subsystem are in an indeterminate state (refer to section 8.1.6.1). |
| | 5<br>Persistent Memory Region Read-Only (PMRRO): If this bit is set to '1', then the Persistent Memory Region has become read-only or unreadable (refer to section 8.2.4). |
| | 4<br>Volatile Memory Backup Failed (VMBF): If this bit is set to '1', then the volatile memory backup device has failed. (This field is only valid if the controller has a volatile memory backup solution). |
| | 3<br>All Media Read-Only (AMRO): If this bit is set to '1', then all of the media has been placed in read only mode. The controller shall not set this bit to '1' if the read-only condition on the media is a result of a change in the write protection state of a namespace (refer to section 8.1.17.1). |
| | 2<br>NVM Subsystem Degraded Reliability (NDR): If this bit is set to '1', then the NVM subsystem reliability has been degraded due to significant media related errors or any internal error that degraded NVM subsystem reliability. |
| | 1<br>Temperature Threshold Condition (TTC): If this bit is set to '1', then a temperature is:<br>a) greater than or equal to an over temperature threshold; or<br>b) less than or equal to an under temperature threshold.<br>(refer to section 5.2.26.1.3). |
| | 0<br>Available Spare Capacity Below Threshold (ASCBT): If this bit is set to '1', then the available spare capacity has fallen below the threshold. |
| 02:01 | **Composite Temperature (CTEMP):** Contains a value corresponding to a temperature in Kelvins that represents the current composite temperature of the controller and namespace(s) associated with the controller. The manner in which this value is computed is implementation specific and may not represent the actual temperature of any physical point in the NVM subsystem. The value of this field may be used to trigger an asynchronous event (refer to section 5.2.26.1.3).<br>Warning and critical overheating composite temperature threshold values are reported by the WCTEMP and CCTEMP fields in the Identify Controller data structure (Figure 328). |
| 03 | **Available Spare (AVSP):** Contains a normalized percentage (0% to 100%) of the remaining spare capacity available. |
| 04 | **Available Spare Threshold (AVSPT):** When the Available Spare falls below the threshold indicated in this field, an asynchronous event completion may occur. The value is indicated as a normalized percentage (0% to 100%). The values 101 to 255 are reserved. |

| :--- | :--- |
| | **Percentage Used (PUSED):** Contains a vendor specific estimate of the percentage of NVM subsystem life used based on the actual usage and the manufacturer's prediction of NVM life. A value of 100 indicates that the estimated endurance of the NVM in the NVM subsystem has been consumed, but may not indicate an NVM subsystem failure. The value is allowed to exceed 100. Percentages greater than 254 shall be represented as 255. This value shall be updated once per power-on hour (when the controller is not in a sleep state).<br>Refer to the JEDEC JESD218-02 standard for SSD device life and endurance measurement techniques. |
| 05 | **Endurance Group Critical Warning Summary (EGCWS):** This field indicates critical warnings for the state of Endurance Groups. Each bit corresponds to a critical warning type, multiple bits may be set to '1'. If a bit is cleared to '0', then that critical warning does not apply to any Endurance Group. Critical warnings may result in an asynchronous event notification to the host. Bits in this field represent the current associated state and are not persistent.<br>If a bit is set to '1' in one or more Endurance Groups, then the corresponding bit shall be set to '1' in this field. |
| | **Bits**<br>**Description** |
| | 7:4<br>Reserved |
| | 3<br>Endurance Group Read-Only (EGRO): If this bit is set to '1', then the namespaces in one or more Endurance Groups have been placed in read only mode not as a result of a change in the write protection state of a namespace (refer to section 8.1.17.1). |
| | 2<br>Endurance Group Degraded Reliability (EGDR): If this bit is set to '1', then the reliability of one or more Endurance Groups has degraded due to significant media related errors or any internal error that degrades NVM subsystem reliability. |
| | 1<br>Reserved |
| | 0<br>Endurance Group Available Spare Capacity Below Threshold (EGASCBT): If this bit is set to '1', then the available spare capacity of one or more Endurance Groups has fallen below the threshold. |
