###### 5.2.12.1.7 Device Self-test (Log Page Identifier 06h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.7 | **Page**: 246-249

This log page is used to indicate:
a) the status of any device self-test operation in progress and the percentage complete of that
operation; and
b) the results of the last 20 device self-test operations.
The Self-test Result data structure (refer to Figure 216) contained in the Result Data Structure 1 field is
always the result of the most recently completed or aborted self-test operation. The next entry in the Device
Self-test Result list in the Device Self-test log page contains the results of the second most recent self-test
operation and so on. If fewer than 20 self-test operations have completed or been aborted, then the Device
Self-test Result field shall be set to Fh (i.e., Entry is empty) and the Self-test Code field shall be cleared to
0h (i.e., Entry is empty) in the Device Self-test Status field in the unused Self-test Result Data Structure
fields and all other fields in that Self-test Result data structure should be ignored by the host.
