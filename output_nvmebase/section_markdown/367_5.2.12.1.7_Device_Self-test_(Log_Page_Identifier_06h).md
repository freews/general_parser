###### 5.2.12.1.7 Device Self-test (Log Page Identifier 06h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.7 | **Page**: 246-249

This log page is used to indicate:
a) the status of any device self-test operation in progress and the percentage complete of that
operation; and
b) the results of the last 20 device self-test operations.
The Self-test Result data structure (refer to Figure 216) contained in the Result Data Structure 1 field is
always the result of the most recently completed or aborted self-test operation. The next entry in the Device
Self-test Result list in the Device Self-test log page contains the results of the second most recent self-test
operation and so on. If fewer than 20 self-test operations have completed or been aborted, then the Device
Self-test Result field shall be set to Fh (i.e., Entry is empty) and the Self-test Code field shall be cleared to
0h (i.e., Entry is empty) in the Device Self-test Status field in the unused Self-test Result Data Structure
fields and all other fields in that Self-test Result data structure should be ignored by the host.

| Bytes | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| | **Current Device Self-Test Operation (CDSTO):** This field defines the current device self-test operation. |
| | | **Bits** | **Description** |
| | | 7:4 | Reserved |
| | | 3:0 | **Device Self-test Operation Status (DSTOS):** This field indicates the status of the current device self-test operation as defined in the following table. If a device self-test operation is in process (i.e., this field is set to 1h or 2h), then the controller shall not set this field to 0h until a new Self-test Result Data Structure is created (i.e., if a device self-test operation completes or is aborted, the controller shall create a Self-test Result Data Structure prior to setting this field to 0h). |
| | | | **Value** | **Definition** |
| | | | 0h | No device self-test operation in progress |
| | | | 1h | Short device self-test operation in progress |
| | | | 2h | Extended device self-test operation in progress |
| | | | 3h | Host-Initiated Refresh operation |
| | | | 4h to Dh | Reserved |
| | | | Eh | Vendor specific |

| | **Current Device Self-Test Completion (CDSTC):** This field defines the completion status of the current device self-test. |
| | | **Bits** | **Description** |
| | | 7 | Reserved |
| | | 6:0 | **Device Self-test Completion Status (DSTCS):** This field indicates the percentage of the device self-test operation that is complete (e.g., a value of 25 indicates that 25% of the device self-test operation is complete and 75% remains to be tested). If the Device Self-test Operation Status (DSTOS) field in the Current Device Self-Test Operation field is cleared to 0h (i.e., there is no device self-test operation in progress), then this field should be ignored by the host. |
