###### 5.2.26.1.10 Non-Operational Power State Config (Feature Identifier 11h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.10 | **Page**: 435-435

This Feature configures non-operational power state settings for the controller. The settings are specified
in Command Dword 11.
If a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the values in Figure 418 are returned in Dword 0
of the completion queue entry for that command.
The Non-Operational Power State Config feature may interact with the Autonomous Power State Transition
feature (refer to section 5.2.26.1.6). Figure 413 shows these interactions.

| Bits | Description |
|---|---|
| 31:01 | Reserved |
| 00 | Non-Operational Power State Permissive Mode Enable (NOPPME): If this bit is set to '1', then the controller may temporarily exceed the power limits of any non-operational power state, up to the limits of the last operational power state, to run controller-initiated background operations in that state (i.e., Non-Operational Power State Permissive Mode is enabled). If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller shall not exceed the limits of any non-operational state while running controller-initiated background operations in that state (i.e., Non-Operational Power State Permissive Mode is disabled).<br><br>If Non-Operational Power State Permissive Mode is disabled, then:<br>a) thermal management that requires power (e.g., cooling fans) may be disabled; and<br>b) performance after resuming from the non-operational power state may be degraded until background activity that was not allowed while in that non-operational power state has completed.<br><br>If the host attempts to set this bit to '1' and the controller does not support Non-Operational Power State Permissive Mode as indicated in the Controller Attributes (CTRATT) field of the Identify Controller data structure, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command. |
