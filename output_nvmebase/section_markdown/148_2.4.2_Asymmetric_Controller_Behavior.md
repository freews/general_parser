#### 2.4.2 Asymmetric Controller Behavior

> **Section ID**: 2.4.2 | **Page**: 60-60

Asymmetric controller behavior occurs in NVM subsystems where namespace access characteristics (e.g.
performance) may vary based on:
•
the internal configuration of the NVM subsystem; or
•
which controller is used to access a namespace (e.g., Fabrics).
NVM subsystems that provide asymmetric controller behavior may support Asymmetric Namespace
Access Reporting as described in section 8.1.1.
