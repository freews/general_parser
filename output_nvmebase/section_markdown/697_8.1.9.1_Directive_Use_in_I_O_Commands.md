##### 8.1.9.1 Directive Use in I/O Commands

> **Section ID**: 8.1.9.1 | **Page**: 576-577

I/O Command Directives are the subset of Directive Types that may be used as part of I/O commands. For
example, a Write command in the NVM Command Set may specify a Directive Type and an associated
Directive Specific value. I/O Command Directives shall have a Directive Type value that is less than or
equal to 0Fh due to the size of the Directive Type field in I/O commands. When a Directive Type is specified
in an I/O command, the most significant four bits are assumed to be 0h. A Directive Type of 00h in an I/O
command specifies that the I/O command is not using Directives.
In an I/O command, if the Directive Type (DTYPE) field is set to an I/O Command Directive, then the
Directive Specific (DSPEC) field includes additional information for the associated I/O command (refer to
Figure 646).
In an I/O command:
•
if no I/O Command Directive is enabled or the DTYPE field is cleared to 00h, then the DTYPE field
and the DSPEC field are ignored; and
•
if one or more I/O Command Directives is enabled and the DTYPE field is set to a value that is not
supported or not enabled, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid
Field in Command.
For the Streams Directive (i.e., DTYPE field set to 01h), if the DSPEC field is cleared to 0h in an I/O
command that supports the Streams Directive, then that I/O command shall be processed normally (i.e., as
if DTYPE field is cleared to 00h).
