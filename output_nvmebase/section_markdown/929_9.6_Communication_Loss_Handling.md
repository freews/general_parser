### 9.6 Communication Loss Handling

> **Section ID**: 9.6 | **Page**: 767-767

If the host loses communication with a controller, then the host is unable to receive a completion (CQE) for
any outstanding command that has been submitted to that controller (refer to section 3.4.5). If the host is
able to use another controller to access the same NVM subsystem or re-establish communication with the
original controller, then it is strongly recommended that any host use of that controller to recover from
communication loss follow the procedures and requirements in this section in order to avoid possible
corruption of user data and unintended changes to NVM subsystem state.
Host recovery from communication loss with a controller consists of three functional components:
•
Host determination that communication with a controller has been lost is described in section 9.6.1.
•
Host determination that no further processing of outstanding commands is possible on that
controller is described in section 9.6.2.
•
Host retry, if any, of outstanding commands after communication loss is described in section 9.6.3.
These functional components interact with each other. Host detection of communication loss is necessary
before the host is able to determine when no further controller processing of outstanding commands is
possible. Host retries of outstanding commands that modify user data or NVM subsystem state are able to
corrupt user data or make unintended changes to NVM subsystem state unless the host determines that
no further controller processing of the original commands is possible as described in section 9.6.2.
