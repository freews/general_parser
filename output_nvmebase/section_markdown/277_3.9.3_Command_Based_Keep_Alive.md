For Command Based Keep Alive, the Keep Alive command is sent periodically from the host to the controller
on the Admin Queue. The completion of the Keep Alive command indicates that the host and controller are
able to communicate. For message-based transports, the Keep Alive Timeout is the maximum time an
association remains established without processing a Keep Alive command.
