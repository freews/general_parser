#### 1.4.3 Byte, Word, and Dword Relationships

> **Section ID**: 1.4.3 | **Page**: 29-29

Figure 3 illustrates the relationship between bytes, words and dwords. A qword (quadruple word) is a unit
of data that is four times the size of a word; it is not illustrated due to space constraints. Unless otherwise
specified, this specification specifies data in a little endian format.
