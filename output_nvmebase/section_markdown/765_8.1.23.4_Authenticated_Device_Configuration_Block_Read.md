##### 8.1.23.4 Authenticated Device Configuration Block Read

> **Section ID**: 8.1.23.4 | **Page**: 643-644

The Authenticated Device Configuration Block Read sequence is initiated by a Security Send command.
The RPMB data frame delivered from the host to the controller includes the Nonce, Request Message Type
= 0007h and the Sector Count = 01h. All other fields are cleared to 0h.
When the host receives a successful completion of the Security Send command from the controller, that
host should send a Security Receive command to the controller to retrieve the data. The controller returns
an RPMB Data Frame with Response Message Type (0700h), the Sector Count = 01h, a copy of the Nonce
received in the request, the RPMB Device Configuration Block Data Structure (refer to Figure 690), the
MAC, the Write Counter set to the current Write Counter value, and the Result. All other fields are cleared
to 0h.
The Write Counter for the Device Configuration Block is independent of the Write Counter for RPMB target
0. The controller returns the Device Configuration Block Write Counter as shown in Figure 700.
The MAC is calculated from Response Type, Nonce, Address, Data and Result fields. If the MAC calculation
fails, then the returned result is 0002h (i.e., authentication failure). If another error occurs during the read
procedure, then the returned Result is 0001h (i.e., general failure).
