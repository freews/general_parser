#### 4.2.3 Status Field Definition

> **Section ID**: 4.2.3 | **Page**: 165-167

The Status field defines the status for the command indicated in the completion queue entry, defined in
Figure 100.
A value of 0h for the Status field indicates a successful command completion, with no fatal or non-fatal error
conditions. Unless otherwise noted, if a command fails to complete successfully for multiple reasons, then
the particular status code returned is chosen by the vendor.
The Status Code (SC) field in the completion queue entry indicates more detailed status information about
the completion being reported.
Each Status Code set of values is split into three ranges:
•
00h to 7Fh: Applicable to Admin Command Set, Fabrics commands, or across multiple command
sets;
NVM Express® Base Specification, Revision 2.3
•
80h to BFh: I/O Command Set specific status codes, or Fabrics command specific status codes;
and
•
C0h to FFh: Vendor Specific status codes.
Unless otherwise specified, if multiple status codes apply, then the controller selects the status code that is
returned.
