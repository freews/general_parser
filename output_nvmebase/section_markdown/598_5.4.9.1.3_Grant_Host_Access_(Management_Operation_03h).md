###### 5.4.9.1.3 Grant Host Access (Management Operation 03h)

> **Section ID**: 5.4.9.1.3 | **Page**: 506-508

The Grant Host Access operation of the Manage Exported NVM Subsystem command is used to grant
hosts access to Exported NVM Subsystems by adding the specified hosts to the Allowed Host List
associated to the specified Exported NVM Subsystem. The data pointer shall point to a Subsystem
Management data structure (refer to Figure 557). The Management Operation Specific field in Command
Dword 10 is reserved and not used by this operation.
The Grant Host Access operation may be used to grant access from a list of hosts (refer to the Host Entry
List and “M” in Figure 557) to a list of Exported NVM Subsystems (refer to the Exported NVM Subsystem
Entry List and “N” in Figure 557) through specified port(s) (refer to Port ID of the Underlying Port in Figure
557) on each of the Exported NVM Subsystems.
The controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command if:
•
the Number of Host Entries field in the Subsystem Management Data Structure (refer to Figure
557) is cleared to 0h; or
•
the Number of Exported NVM Subsystem Entries field in the Subsystem Management Data
Structure (refer to Figure 557) is cleared to 0h.
Command specific status values associated with the Grant Host Access operation of the Manage Exported
NVM Subsystem command are defined in Figure 560. For failures, the byte offset of a failing entry shall be
reported in the Command Specific Information field of the Error Information Log Entry.
