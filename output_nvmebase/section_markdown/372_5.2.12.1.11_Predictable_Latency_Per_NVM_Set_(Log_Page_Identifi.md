###### 5.2.12.1.11 Predictable Latency Per NVM Set (Log Page Identifier 0Ah)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.11 | **Page**: 256-258

This log page may be used to determine the current window for the specified NVM Set when Predictable
Latency Mode is enabled and any events that have occurred for the specified NVM Set. There is one log
page for each NVM Set when Predictable Latency Mode is supported. The NVM Set for which the log page
is to be returned is specified in the Log Specific Identifier field in Command Dword 11 of the Get Log Page
command as defined in Figure 223. The log page is 512 bytes in size.
The log page indicates typical values and reliable estimates for attributes associated with the Deterministic
Window and the Non-Deterministic Window of the specified NVM Set. The Typical, Maximum, and Minimum
values are static and worst-case values over the lifetime of the NVM subsystem.
After the controller successfully completes a read of this log page with Retain Asynchronous Event bit
cleared to ‘0’, then reported events are cleared to ‘0’ for the specified NVM Set and the field corresponding
to the specified NVM Set is cleared to ‘0’ in the Predictable Latency Event Aggregate log page. Co-
ordination between two or more hosts is beyond the scope of this specification.
