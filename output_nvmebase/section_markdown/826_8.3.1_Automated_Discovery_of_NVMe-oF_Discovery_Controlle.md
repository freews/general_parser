#### 8.3.1 Automated Discovery of NVMe-oF Discovery Controllers for IP Based Fabrics

> **Section ID**: 8.3.1 | **Page**: 697-698

When operating in an IP based fabric, before transmitting a Fabrics Connect command, the IP address of
the fabric interface of the Discovery controller is determined by one of the following methods:
a) administrative configuration;
b) discovered using DNS-SD (refer to RFC 6763); or
c) obtained by some means not defined in this specification.
DNS-SD information may be retrieved using mDNS (refer to RFC 6762) or from a DNS server (refer to RFC
1034 and RFC 1035).
When DNS-SD is used as described in this section, hosts, CDCs and DDCs may use DNS-SD to perform
automated discovery of Discovery controllers in IP fabrics consisting of:
a) Two IP interfaces (i.e., a host and an NVM subsystem) physically connected to one another (refer
to Figure 729);
b) Many IP interfaces participating in one or more Broadcast Domains (refer to Figure 730); or
c) A Centralized Discovery controller and many IP interfaces that may reside in multiple Broadcast
Domains (refer to Figure 731).
mDNS is a multicast protocol that allows discovery of IP interfaces within the same Broadcast Domain.
Discovering IP interfaces outside of the Broadcast Domain using mDNS requires either the use of RFC
8766 or an mDNS NVMe-oF proxy. An mDNS NVMe-oF proxy is an mDNS responder that is responsive to
queries for either the “_nvme-disc” service or the “_cdc._sub._nvme-disc” service and responds with the
information defined in section 8.3.1.1.2.
