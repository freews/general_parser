#### 3.9.2 Keep Alive Timer Activation

> **Section ID**: 3.9.2 | **Page**: 151-151

The Keep Alive Timer is active if:
•
CC.EN is set to ‘1’;
•
CSTS.RDY is set to ‘1’;
•
CC.SHN is cleared to ‘00b’;
•
CSTS.SHST is cleared to ‘00b’; and
•
the Keep Alive Timer feature is enabled as a result of the KATO field being set to a non-zero value
(refer to section 3.9.1).
Otherwise, the Keep Alive Timer is inactive, and a Keep Alive Timeout as described in sections 3.9.3.1 and
3.9.4.1 shall not occur on the controller. Activating an inactive Keep Alive Timer (e.g., a Set Features
command successfully setting the Keep Alive Timeout value to a non-zero value from a value of 0h, or the
host enabling a controller that supports NVMe over Fabrics where the Connect command specified a non-
zero Keep Alive Timeout value (refer to Figure 579)) shall initialize the Keep Alive Timer to the Keep Alive
Timeout value.
While the Keep Alive Timer is active, the host should ensure that the Admin Submission Queue has space
for a Keep Alive command.
