#### 8.3.4 Exporting NVM Resources

> **Section ID**: 8.3.4 | **Page**: 733-733

Exported Resource Management is a capability that may be supported in an NVM subsystem that only
contains controllers that use transports other than the Memory-Based Transport Model (e.g., the PCIe
transport).
Exporting an Underlying Namespace may be achieved by:
•
creating an Exported NVM Subsystem (refer to section 5.4.2);
•
assigning an Underlying Namespace to an Exported NVM Subsystem (refer to section 5.4.8.1.1);
•
attaching a transport to the Exported NVM Subsystem to enable remote access to the Exported
NVM Subsystem (refer to section 5.4.10.1.1); and
•
optionally assigning access control policies for the Exported NVM Subsystem (refer to sections
5.4.9.1.3 and 5.4.9.1.4).
Exported NVM Subsystems shall not expose information about Underlying NVM Subsystem resources or
entities that are not associated with Exported NVM Subsystem entities. This includes entities in Underlying
NVM Subsystems (e.g., NSID, NVM Set Identifiers, ANA Group Identifiers).
