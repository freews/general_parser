###### 8.3.1.3.4 DDC Processing of DNS-SD records

> **Section ID**: 8.3.1.3.4 | **Page**: 701-701

Upon reception of an mDNS or DNS response that contains a DNS SRV record with the service name set
to “_cdc._sub._nvme-disc”, the DDC may use the IP address in the A or AAAA record as the destination IP
address to either:
a. Perform push registration (refer to section 8.3.2.2.1) with the CDC; or
b. Request a pull registration (refer to section 8.3.2.2.2) from the CDC (e.g., using Kickstart Discovery
Request PDU (KDReq) section in the NVMe over TCP Transport Specification).
If a DDC supports mDNS and has been configured to perform push registration (refer to section 8.3.2.2.1),
or has been configured to request a pull registration (refer to section 8.3.2.2.2) from a CDC, the DDC should
cease responding to mDNS requests for the service name of “_nvme-disc.<protocol>.local” if a CDC is
detected as defined in section 8.3.1.3.3.
