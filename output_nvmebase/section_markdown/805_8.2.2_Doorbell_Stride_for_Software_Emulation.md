#### 8.2.2 Doorbell Stride for Software Emulation

> **Section ID**: 8.2.2 | **Page**: 684-684

The doorbell stride, specified in CAP.DSTRD (refer to Figure 36), may be used to separate doorbells by a
number of bytes in memory space. The doorbell stride is a number of bytes equal to (2 ^ (2 + CAP.DSTRD)).
This is useful in software emulation of an NVM Express controller. In this case, a software thread is
monitoring doorbell notifications. The software thread may be made more efficient by monitoring one
doorbell per discrete cacheline or utilize the monitor/mwait CPU instructions. For hardware implementations
of the NVM Express interface, the expected doorbell stride value is 0h.
