#### 5.2.3 Capacity Management command

> **Section ID**: 5.2.3 | **Page**: 209-210

A host uses the Capacity Management command to configure Endurance Groups and NVM Sets in an
NVM subsystem by either selecting one of a set of supported configurations (i.e., Fixed Capacity
Management; refer to section 8.1.4.2) or by specifying the capacity of the Endurance Group or NVM Set to
be created (i.e., Variable Capacity Management; refer to section 8.1.4.3). The Capacity Management
command specifies the operations defined in Figure 160.
The Capacity Management command uses the Command Dword 10, Command Dword 11, and Command
Dword 12 fields. All other command specific fields are reserved.
For requirements to support the operations in Figure 160, refer to section 8.1.4.
If the Operation field specifies the Create Endurance Group operation or the Create NVM Set operation,
then the Capacity Upper and Capacity Lower fields specify the capacity of the Endurance Group or NVM
Set to be created. If the Operation field specifies any other operation, then the Capacity Upper field and the
Capacity Lower field are reserved.
