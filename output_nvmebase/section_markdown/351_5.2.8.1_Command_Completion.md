##### 5.2.8.1 Command Completion

> **Section ID**: 5.2.8.1 | **Page**: 221-223

Upon completion of the Firmware Commit command, the controller posts a completion queue entry to the
Admin Completion Queue indicating the status for the command.
For Firmware Commit commands that specify activation of a new firmware image at the next Controller
Level Reset (i.e., the CA field was set to 001b or 010b) and complete with a status code value of 0h (i.e.,
Success Completion), a Controller Level Reset initiated by any of the methods defined in section 3.7.2
activates the specified firmware.
If the controller detects overlapping firmware/boot partition image update command sequences (refer to
section 1.5.42) of more than one firmware image and/or Boot Partition or the use of more than one controller
and/or Management Endpoint to update a single firmware image, then the results of that detection are
reported in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry as defined in Figure 186. Refer to section 3.11 and
section 8.1.3.2.
If:
a) the Commit Action field is cleared to 000b (i.e., update the firmware image in the specified firmware
slot but do not activate);
b) the Firmware Slot field is set to the active firmware slot (refer to Figure 212); and
c) the controller supports greater than one firmware slot for a host to store firmware images,
then the controller may abort the command with a status code of Command Sequence Error. A host may
avoid this result by using a different firmware slot.
Firmware Commit command specific status values (i.e., SCT field set to 1h) are shown in Figure 187.
