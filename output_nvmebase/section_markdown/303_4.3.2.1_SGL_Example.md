##### 4.3.2.1 SGL Example

> **Section ID**: 4.3.2.1 | **Page**: 184-185

Figure 124 shows an example of a data read request using SGLs. In the example, the logical block size is
512B. The total length of the logical blocks accessed is 13 KiB, of which only 11 KiB is transferred to the
host. The Number of Logical Blocks (NLB) field in the command shall specify 26, indicating the total length
of the logical blocks accessed on the controller is 13 KiB. There are three SGL segments describing the
locations in memory where the logical block data is transferred.
The three SGL segments contain a total of three Data Block descriptors with lengths of 3 KiB, 4 KiB, and
4 KiB respectively. Segment 1 of the Destination SGL contains a Bit Bucket descriptor with a length of 2 KiB
that specifies to not transfer (i.e., ignore) 2 KiB of logical block data from the NVM. Segment 1 of the
destination SGL also contains a Last Segment descriptor specifying that the segment pointed to by the
descriptor is the last SGL segment.
