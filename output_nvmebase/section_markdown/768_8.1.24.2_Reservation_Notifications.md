##### 8.1.24.2 Reservation Notifications

> **Section ID**: 8.1.24.2 | **Page**: 648-648

There are three types of reservation notifications: registration preempted, reservation released, and
reservation preempted. Conditions that cause a reservation notification to occur are described in the
following sections. A Reservation Notification log page is created whenever an unmasked reservation
notification occurs on a namespace associated with the controller (refer to section 5.2.12.1.34). Reservation
notifications may be masked from generating a Reservation Notification log page on a per reservation
notification type and per namespace ID basis through the Reservation Notification Mask feature (refer to
section 5.2.26.1.33). A host may use the Asynchronous Event Request command (refer to section 5.2.2)
to be notified of the presence of one or more available Reservation Notification log pages (refer to section
5.2.12.1.34).
