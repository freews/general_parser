##### 3.8.2.2 Vertically-Organized NVM Subsystem

> **Section ID**: 3.8.2.2 | **Page**: 147-148

Figure 87 shows an example of a single domain NVM subsystem where the performance goal is isolation
among four NVM Sets at the cost of bandwidth. Endurance is managed separately for each NVM Set.
Media Units sharing a Channel are allocated to the same Endurance Group. All Media Units in an
Endurance Group are allocated to the same NVM Set. The bandwidth for any NVM Set is likely to be less
than or equal to the bandwidth of the Channel of that NVM Set.
The Capacity Configuration Descriptor for this example contains four Endurance Group Configuration
Descriptors. Each Endurance Group Configuration Descriptor contains one NVM Set Identifier and one
Channel Configuration Descriptor. Each Channel Configuration Descriptor contains four Media Unit
Configuration Descriptors.
