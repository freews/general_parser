### 3.9 Keep Alive

> **Section ID**: 3.9 | **Page**: 150-151

The Keep Alive capability uses the Keep Alive Timer on a controller as a watchdog timer to detect
communication failures (e.g., transport failure, host failure, or controller failure) between a host and a
controller. If the Keep Alive Timer feature is supported (i.e., the KAS field is set to a non-zero value (refer
to Figure 328)), the controller shall support the Keep Alive command.
The term Keep Alive Timeout Time (KATT) refers to the time indicated by the value of the Keep Alive
Timeout field on a controller (refer to Figure 416).
The NVMe Transport binding specification for the associated NVMe Transport defines:
•
the minimum Keep Alive Timeout value, if any;
•
the maximum Keep Alive Timeout value, if any; and
•
if the Keep Alive Timer feature is required to be supported and enabled.
NVMe Transports that do not detect a connection loss in a timely manner shall require that the Keep Alive
Timer feature be supported and enabled.
