##### 8.1.10.4 Prohibiting Host Access to Dispersed Namespaces

> **Section ID**: 8.1.10.4 | **Page**: 591-592

If a participating NVM subsystem prohibits host access to dispersed namespaces when the Host Dispersed
Namespace Support (HDISNS) field is cleared to 0h in the Host Behavior Support feature, then the
controller shall abort the following commands with a status code of Host Dispersed Namespace Support
Not Enabled:
•
any I/O commands (refer to section 7 in this specification and the I/O Commands section in the
applicable NVM Express I/O Command Set specification) that specify the NSID of a dispersed
namespace in the command; or
•
any of the Admin commands listed in Figure 663 that specify the NSID of a dispersed namespace
in the command.
The Additional Restrictions column in Figure 663 lists additional restrictions that apply while the HDISNS
field is cleared to 0h in the Host Behavior Support feature for Admin commands that are capable of affecting
dispersed namespaces without specifying the NSID of a dispersed namespace.
