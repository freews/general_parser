#### 1.1.1 NVM Express® Specification Family

> **Section ID**: 1.1.1 | **Page**: 25-25

Figure 1 shows the relationship of the NVM Express specifications to each other within the NVMe® family
of specifications.
The NVM Express specification family structure shown in Figure 1 is intended to show the applicability of
NVM Express specifications to each other, not a hierarchy, protocol stack, or system architecture.
The NVM Express Base Specification (i.e., this specification) defines a protocol for a host to communicate
with an NVM subsystem over a variety of memory-based transports and message-based transports.
The NVM Express Management Interface (NVMe-MI) Specification defines an optional management
interface for all NVM Express Subsystems.
NVM Express I/O Command Set specifications define data structures, features, log pages, commands, and
status values that extend the NVM Express Base Specification.
NVM Express Transport specifications define the binding of the NVMe protocol including controller
properties to a specific transport.
The NVM Express Boot Specification defines constructs and guidelines for booting from NVM Express
interfaces.
