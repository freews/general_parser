###### 8.3.2.3.4.3 {(NQN, IP, Protocol), Role} Zone Member Type (Type 2h)

> **Section ID**: 8.3.2.3.4.3 | **Page**: 713-713

This Zone member type identifies a specific fabric interface (i.e., through the IP address) and the specific
IP protocol (e.g., TCP) used by the NVMe-oF entity identified by the Zone member’s NQN over that fabric
interface. The format of this Zone member type is shown in Figure 744.

| Bytes | Description |
|:---|:---|
| 00 | **Zone Member Type (ZMTYPE):** This field specifies the Zone member type and shall be set to 2h. |
| 02:01 | **Zone Member Length (ZMLEN):** This field specifies the length in bytes of this Zone member type and shall be set to 100h. |
| 03 | **Zone Member Role (ZMROLE):** This field specifies what type of entity the Zone member is. This field shall be set to one of the following values:<br>• 1h: host; or<br>• 2h: NVM subsystem. |
| 04 | **Zone Member Address Family (ZMADRFAM):** This field specifies the IP address family. This field shall be set to one of the following values:<br>• 1h: IPv4 address family; or<br>• 2h: IPv6 address family. |
| 05 | **Zone Member IP Protocol (ZMIPPROTO):** This field specifies the IP protocol. This field shall be set to one of the following values:<br>• 6h: TCP; or<br>• 11h: UDP. |
| 07:06 | Reserved |
| 23:08 | **Zone Member Transport Address (ZMTRADDR):** This field specifies the IP address. An IPv6 address is encoded in binary as follows:<br> <table> <tr> <th>Bytes</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>15:00</td> <td>**IPv6 Address (IPV6ADDR):** This field contains an IPv6 address.</td> </tr> </table> <br> An IPv4 address is encoded in binary as follows:<br> <table> <tr> <th>Bytes</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>03:00</td> <td>**IPv4 Address (IPV4ADDR):** This field contains an IPv4 address.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>15:04</td> <td>Reserved</td> </tr> </table> |
| 31:24 | Reserved |
| 255:32 | **Zone Member NQN (ZMNQN):** This field specifies the NQN (represented as a null-terminated string, NULL padded as necessary to the 224-byte maximum length) of the referenced NVMe-oF entity. |
