###### 5.2.26.1.34 Reservation Persistence (Feature Identifier 83h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.34 | **Page**: 464-465

Each namespace that supports reservations has a Persist Through Power Loss (PTPL) state that may be
modified using either a Set Features command or a Reservation Register command (refer to section 7.6).
The Reservation Persistence feature attributes are specified in Command Dword 11.
The PTPL state is contained in the Reservation Persistence feature that is namespace specific. A Set
Features command that uses the namespace ID FFFFFFFFh modifies the PTPL state associated with all
namespaces that are attached to the controller and that support PTPL (i.e., support reservations). A Set
Features command that uses a valid namespace ID other than FFFFFFFFh and corresponds to a
namespace that supports reservations, modifies the PTPL state for that namespace. A Get Features
command that uses a namespace ID of FFFFFFFFh shall be aborted with a status code of Invalid Field in
Command. A Get Features command that uses a valid namespace ID other than FFFFFFFFh and
corresponds to a namespace that supports PTPL, returns the PTPL state for that namespace. If a Set
Features command or a Get Features command using a namespace ID other than FFFFFFFFh attempts
to access the PTPL state for a namespace that does not support this Feature Identifier, then the command
is aborted with status code of Invalid Field in Command.
This feature shall not be saveable (refer to Figure 199).
If a Get Features command successfully completes for this Feature Identifier, the attributes specified in
Figure 469 are returned in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.
