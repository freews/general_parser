###### 5.2.26.1.24.1.1 Physical Credential Authentication

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.24.1.1 | **Page**: 449-449

Physical Credential Authentication (refer to the PCAS bit in Figure 285) provides the means to unfreeze a
currently frozen personality using a Physical Presence Indicator (PPI).
The physical credential is a vendor-defined PPI that is only readable by someone with physical possession
of the device (e.g., an identifier printed in the device label) and is prohibited to be returned to the host by
any programmatic interface (e.g., a command).
Refer to the TCG Storage Opal SSC Feature Set: PSID Specification for recommended guidelines on how
to implement a physical credential. It is recommended that the length of the authentication credential be 32
bytes minimum.
