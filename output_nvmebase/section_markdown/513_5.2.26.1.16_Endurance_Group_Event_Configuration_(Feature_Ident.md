###### 5.2.26.1.16 Endurance Group Event Configuration (Feature Identifier 18h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.16 | **Page**: 440-440

This Feature controls the events that trigger adding an Endurance Group Event Aggregate Log Change
Notices event to the Endurance Group Event Aggregate log for the specified Endurance Group. This
Feature may be used to disable reporting events in the case of a persistent condition (refer to section 5.2.2).
If the condition for an event is true when the corresponding notice is enabled, then an event is sent to the
host. The attributes are specified in Command Dword 11.
If a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the Endurance Group Critical Warnings field in
Command Dword 11 is not used and the attributes specified in Figure 428 are returned in Dword 0 of the
completion queue entry for that command.
If a bit is set to ‘1’ in the Endurance Group Critical Warnings field which corresponds to a reserved bit in the
Critical Warning field of the Endurance Group Information log page (refer to Figure 222), then the Set
Features command shall be aborted with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.
If the Endurance Group Identifier specifies an Endurance Group that does not exist, then the Set Features
or Get Features command shall be aborted with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.

If a bit is set to '1', then an entry is added when the corresponding critical warning bit is set to '1' in the Endurance Group Information log page.
