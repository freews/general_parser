###### 5.2.12.1.16 Media Unit Status (Log Page Identifier 10h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.16 | **Page**: 285-287

This log page is used to describe the configuration and wear of Media Units (refer to section 8.1.4). The log
page contains one Media Unit Status Descriptor for each Media Unit accessible by the specified domain.
Each Media Unit Status Descriptor (refer to Figure 260) indicates the configuration of the Media Unit (e.g.,
to which Endurance Group the Media Unit is assigned, to which NVM Set the Media Unit is assigned, to
which Channels the Media Unit is attached) and indications of wear (e.g., the Available Spare field and the
Percentage Used field). The indications of wear change as the Media Unit is written and read.
If the NVM subsystem supports multiple domains, then the controller reports the Media Unit Status log page
for the domain specified in the Log Specific Identifier field (refer to Figure 258), if accessible. If the
information is not accessible, then the log page is not available (refer to section 8.1.1.10). If the Log Specific
Identifier field is cleared to 0h, then the specified domain is the domain containing the controller that is
processing the command.
Media Unit Identifier values (refer to Figure 260) begin with 0h and increase sequentially. If the NVM
subsystem supports multiple domains, then the Media Unit Identifier values are unique within the specified
domain. If the NVM subsystem does not support multiple domains, then the Media Unit Identifier values are
unique within the NVM subsystem.
Media Unit Status Descriptors are listed in ascending order by Media Unit Identifier.
Requirements for supporting the Media Unit Status log page are defined in section 8.1.4.
The Media Unit Status Descriptor is defined in Figure 260.
If the Selected Configuration field is cleared to 0h, then the following fields in each Media Unit Status
Descriptor shall be cleared to 0h:
a) Endurance Group Identifier (ENDGID);
b) NVM Set Identifier (NVMSETID);
c) Capacity Adjustment Factor; and
d) Number of Channels (MUCS).
Channel Identifier values begin with 0h and increase sequentially. If the NVM subsystem supports multiple
domains, then Channel Identifier values are unique within the specified domain. If the NVM subsystem does
not support multiple domains, then Channel Identifier values are unique within the NVM subsystem.
In the Media Unit Status Descriptor, Channel Identifiers are listed in ascending order by value, and each
Channel Identifier shall appear only once.
