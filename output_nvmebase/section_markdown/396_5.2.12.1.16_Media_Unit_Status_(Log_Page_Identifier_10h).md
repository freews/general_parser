###### 5.2.12.1.16 Media Unit Status (Log Page Identifier 10h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.16 | **Page**: 285-287

This log page is used to describe the configuration and wear of Media Units (refer to section 8.1.4). The log
page contains one Media Unit Status Descriptor for each Media Unit accessible by the specified domain.
Each Media Unit Status Descriptor (refer to Figure 260) indicates the configuration of the Media Unit (e.g.,
to which Endurance Group the Media Unit is assigned, to which NVM Set the Media Unit is assigned, to
which Channels the Media Unit is attached) and indications of wear (e.g., the Available Spare field and the
Percentage Used field). The indications of wear change as the Media Unit is written and read.
If the NVM subsystem supports multiple domains, then the controller reports the Media Unit Status log page
for the domain specified in the Log Specific Identifier field (refer to Figure 258), if accessible. If the
information is not accessible, then the log page is not available (refer to section 8.1.1.10). If the Log Specific
Identifier field is cleared to 0h, then the specified domain is the domain containing the controller that is
processing the command.
Media Unit Identifier values (refer to Figure 260) begin with 0h and increase sequentially. If the NVM
subsystem supports multiple domains, then the Media Unit Identifier values are unique within the specified
domain. If the NVM subsystem does not support multiple domains, then the Media Unit Identifier values are
unique within the NVM subsystem.
Media Unit Status Descriptors are listed in ascending order by Media Unit Identifier.
Requirements for supporting the Media Unit Status log page are defined in section 8.1.4.
The Media Unit Status Descriptor is defined in Figure 260.
If the Selected Configuration field is cleared to 0h, then the following fields in each Media Unit Status
Descriptor shall be cleared to 0h:
a) Endurance Group Identifier (ENDGID);
b) NVM Set Identifier (NVMSETID);
c) Capacity Adjustment Factor; and
d) Number of Channels (MUCS).
Channel Identifier values begin with 0h and increase sequentially. If the NVM subsystem supports multiple
domains, then Channel Identifier values are unique within the specified domain. If the NVM subsystem does
not support multiple domains, then Channel Identifier values are unique within the NVM subsystem.
In the Media Unit Status Descriptor, Channel Identifiers are listed in ascending order by value, and each
Channel Identifier shall appear only once.

| Bits | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 15:00 | **Domain Identifier (DID):** This field specifies the identifier for the domain (refer to section 3.2.5) used for this log page.<br>If the NVM subsystem does not support multiple domains, then this field is reserved.<br>If this field specifies a non-zero Domain Identifier that is not reported in the Domain List (refer to section 5.2.13.2.15), then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command. |
| Bytes | Description |
| | **Header** |
| 01:00 | **Number of Media Unit Status Descriptors (NMU):** This field indicates the number of Media Unit Status Descriptors in the log page. If this field is cleared to 0h, then no Media Unit Status Descriptors are reported. |
| 03:02 | **Number of Channels (CCHANS):** This field indicates the number of Channels accessible by the controller. A value of 0h indicates that the number of Channels accessible by the controller is not reported. |
| 05:04 | **Selected Configuration (SELC):** This field indicates the Configuration Identifier selected by the most recent successful completion of the Capacity Management command Select Capacity Configuration operation. If a Select Capacity Configuration operation has not been completed, this field may indicate a non-zero value (i.e., a configuration was selected by default). If a Configuration Identifier is not selected, then this field shall be cleared to 0h. |
| 15:06 | **Reserved** |
| | **Media Unit Status Descriptor List** |
| NOTE 1 | **Media Unit Status Descriptor 0:** This field contains the first Media Unit Status Descriptor (refer to Figure 260), if any. |
| NOTE 1 | **Media Unit Status Descriptor 1:** This field contains the second Media Unit Status Descriptor, if any. |
| NOTE 1 | **Media Unit Status Descriptor NMU-1:** This field contains the last Media Unit Status Descriptor, if any. |

| Bytes | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 01:00 | **Media Unit Identifier (MUID):** This field indicates the identifier of the Media Unit. |
| 03:02 | **Domain Identifier (DID):** This field indicates the identifier of the domain that contains this Media Unit. Refer to section 3.2.5.4. A value of 0h indicates that a Domain Identifier is not reported. If multiple domains are not supported, then this field shall be cleared to 0h. |
| 05:04 | **Endurance Group Identifier (ENDGID):** This field indicates the identifier of the Endurance Group that contains this Media Unit. Refer to section 3.2.3. The value shall be less than or equal to the value of the Endurance Group Identifier Maximum field (refer to Figure 328). A value of 0h indicates that this Media Unit is not part of an Endurance Group. |
| 07:06 | **NVM Set Identifier (NVMSETID):** This field indicates the identifier of the NVM Set that contains this Media Unit. Refer to section 3.2.2. This field shall indicate a value less than or equal to the value of the NVM Set Identifier Maximum field (refer to Figure 328). <br> If the controller does not support NVM Sets, then this field shall be cleared to 0h. |
| 09:08 | **Capacity Adjustment Factor (CAF):** This field indicates the capacity adjustment factor (refer to section 8.1.4.1) for this Endurance Group. <br> A value of FFhFh indicates that the Capacity Adjustment Factor is not reported. <br> All Media Unit Status Descriptors which indicate the same Endurance Group Identifier shall indicate the same value in their Capacity Adjustment Factor fields. |
| 10 | **Available Spare (AVSP):** Contains a normalized percentage (0 to 100%) of the remaining spare capacity available for the Media Unit. The relationship between this value and the value in the Available Spare field in the Endurance Group Information log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.10) is outside the scope of this specification. |
| 11 | **Percentage Used (PUSED):** Contains a vendor specific estimate of the percentage of life used for the Media Unit based on the actual usage and the manufacturer's prediction of NVM life. A value of 100 indicates that the estimated endurance of the NVM in the Media Unit has been consumed, but may not indicate an NVM failure. The value is allowed to exceed 100. Percentages greater than 254 shall be represented as 255. This value shall be updated once per power-on hour when the controller is not in a sleep state. <br> Refer to the JEDEC JESD218B-02 standard for SSD device life and endurance measurement techniques. <br> The relationship between this value and the value in the Percentage Used field in the Endurance Group Information log page is outside the scope of this specification. |
| 12 | **Number of Channels (MUCS):** This field indicates the number of Channels attached to this Media Unit. If this field is cleared to 0h, then no Channel Identifiers are reported for this Media Unit. |
| 13 | **Channel Identifiers Offset (CIO):** This field indicates the offset of the Channel 0 identifier field from the beginning of the Media Unit Status Descriptor. This field shall be a non-zero value and a multiple of 16. |
