##### 5.2.1.2 Command Completion

> **Section ID**: 5.2.1.2 | **Page**: 201-201

Upon completion of the Abort command, the controller posts a completion queue entry to the Admin
Completion Queue indicating the status for the Abort command. Dword 0 of the completion queue entry
indicates information about the command to abort as shown in Figure 147.
If the Immediate Abort Not Performed bit in Dword 0 (refer to Figure 147) is set to ‘1’ in the completion
queue entry for the Abort command and a deferred abort is performed, then the controller shall set the
status code for the command to abort to Command Abort Requested. The host should examine the status
in the completion queue entry of the command to abort to determine if the command was aborted.
Command specific status code values associated with the Abort command are defined in Figure 148.
