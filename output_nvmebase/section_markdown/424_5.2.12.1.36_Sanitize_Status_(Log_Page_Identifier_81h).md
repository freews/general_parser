###### 5.2.12.1.36 Sanitize Status (Log Page Identifier 81h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.36 | **Page**: 319-325

The Sanitize Status log page is used to report sanitize operation time estimates and information about the
most recent sanitize operation (refer to section 8.1.26) for the specified sanitization target.
The Get Log Page command returns a data buffer containing a log page formatted as defined in Figure
302. This log page shall be retained across power cycles and resets. If the controller is not able to report
valid data (e.g., due to a division event that prevents reporting sanitize status information), then the Get
Log Page command shall be aborted with a status code of Controller Pathing Error. If a Get Log Page
command is aborted with a status code of Controller Pathing Error, then submitting a subsequent Get Log
Page command to a controller with a different domain identifier and requesting the same Sanitize Status
log page may be successful. If the controller is able to report valid data, then this log page shall contain
valid data whenever CSTS.RDY is set to ‘1’.
If the Sanitize Capabilities (SANICAP) field in the Identify Controller data structure is not cleared to 0h (i.e.,
the Sanitize command is supported), then this log page shall be supported. If the Sanitize Capabilities field
in the Identify Controller data structure is cleared to 0h, then this log page is reserved.
If the Sanitize Namespace command is supported, then this log page shall support setting the NSID field
to the value of an allocated NSID.
The NSID field in the Get Log Page command specifies the sanitization target for the requested Sanitize
Status log page (i.e., whether the scope of the Sanitize Status log page is the NVM subsystem or a
namespace). If the NSID field is set to:
•
0h or is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the Sanitize Status log page for the NVM subsystem is requested;
or
•
an allocated NSID, then the Sanitize Status log page for the namespace indicated by the NSID is
requested.
If the NSID specified in the NSID field specifies an unallocated NSID, then the command shall be aborted
with a status code of Invalid Namespace or Format.
If the NSID field specifies a namespace as the sanitization target and an NVM subsystem sanitize operation
is in progress, then the command shall be aborted with a status code of Sanitize In Progress.
If the NSID field specifies a namespace as the sanitization target and the NVM subsystem is in the
Restricted Failure state or the Unrestricted Failure state, then the command shall be aborted with a status
code of Sanitize Failed.
