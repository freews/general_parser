#### 5.2.21 Namespace Management command

> **Section ID**: 5.2.21 | **Page**: 413-414

The Namespace Management command is used to manage namespaces (refer to section 8.1.16), including
create and delete operations.
Note: The controller continues to execute commands submitted to I/O Submission Queues while this
operation is in progress.
If the Namespace Management command is supported, then the Namespace Attachment command (refer
to section 5.2.20) shall also be supported. The Namespace Management command shall not be supported
by controllers in an Exported NVM subsystem.
The host uses the Namespace Attachment command to attach or detach a namespace to or from a
controller. The create operation does not attach the namespace to a controller. As a side effect of the delete
operation, the namespace is detached from all controllers as the namespace is no longer present in the
system. It is recommended that the host detach all controllers from a namespace prior to deleting the
namespace. If the namespace is not detached from all controllers prior to being deleted, then Attached
Namespace Attribute Changed asynchronous events are reported as specified in section 8.1.16.2. If a
namespace is deleted, then Allocated Namespace Attribute Changed asynchronous events are reported
as specified in section 8.1.16.2.
The data structure used for the create operation is defined in Figure 385 and the CSI field specifies the I/O
Command Set specification. There is no data structure transferred for the delete operation.
The Namespace Management command uses the Data Pointer, Command Dword 10, and Command
Dword 11 fields. All other command specific fields are reserved.
The Namespace Identifier (NSID) field is used as follows for create and delete operations:
•
Create: The NSID field is reserved for this operation; a host clears this field to a value of 0h. The
controller shall select an available Namespace Identifier to use for the operation; or
•
Delete: This field specifies the previously created namespace to delete in this operation. Specifying
a value of FFFFFFFFh is used to delete all namespaces in the NVM subsystem. If the value of
FFFFFFFFh is specified and there are zero valid namespaces, the command completes
successfully.

| 127:00 | **Data Pointer (DPTR):** This field specifies the start of the data buffer. Refer to Figure 92 for the definition of this field. If using PRPs, this field shall not be a pointer to a PRP List as the data buffer may not cross more than one page boundary. |
| 31:04 | Reserved |
| 03:00 | **Select (SEL):** This field selects the type of management operation to perform.<br>![](https://i.imgur.com/1a2b3c4.png) |
| 31:24 | **Command Set Identifier (CSI):** For a create operation (i.e., SEL 0h), this field specifies the I/O Command Set for the created namespace. A CSI value of 0h creates a namespace using the NVM Command Set. For all other operations this field is reserved.<br>Values for this field are defined by Figure 327. |
| 23:0 | Reserved |
| 511:00 | **Specific to the I/O Command Set (SIOCS):** Refer to the Namespace Management command section of the applicable NVM Express I/O Command Set specification. |
