#### 9.6.3 Command Retry After Communication Loss

> **Section ID**: 9.6.3 | **Page**: 770-770

If the host loses communication with a controller, then the host is unable to receive a completion (CQE) for
any outstanding command (refer to section 3.4.5) that has been submitted to that controller. If the host is
able to use another controller to access the same NVM subsystem or re-establish communication with the
original controller, the host may be able to use that controller to recover from the communication loss by
retrying outstanding commands. It is strongly recommended that any host retry of any outstanding
commands after communication loss follow the procedures and requirements in this section in order to
avoid possible corruption of user data and unintended changes to NVM subsystem state (e.g., Reservation
state (refer to section 8.1.24)).
For command retry purposes, every outstanding command falls into one of three command retry categories,
Unrestricted Retry, Delayed Retry, or State-Dependent Retry, based on whether the command is
idempotent (refer to section 9.6.3.1), and whether the command modifies user data or NVM subsystem
state. Section 9.6.3.2 defines these categories and describes requirements and restrictions on retrying
outstanding commands in each category.
