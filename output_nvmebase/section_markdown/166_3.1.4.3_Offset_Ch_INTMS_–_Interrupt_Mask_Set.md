##### 3.1.4.3 Offset Ch: INTMS – Interrupt Mask Set

> **Section ID**: 3.1.4.3 | **Page**: 81-82

This property is used to mask interrupts when using pin-based interrupts, single message MSI, or multiple
message MSI. When using MSI-X, the interrupt mask table defined as part of MSI-X should be used to
mask interrupts. A host shall not access this property when configured for MSI-X; any accesses when
configured for MSI-X is undefined. For interrupt behavior requirements, refer to the Interrupts section of the
NVMe over PCIe Transport Specification.

| Bits | Type | Reset | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 31:00 | RWS | 0h | Interrupt Vector Mask Set (IVMS): This field is bit significant. If a '1' is written to a bit, then the corresponding interrupt vector is masked from generating an interrupt or reporting a pending interrupt in the MSI Capability Structure. Writing a '0' to a bit has no effect. When read, this field returns the current interrupt mask value within the controller (not the value of this property). If a bit has a value of a '1', then the corresponding interrupt vector is masked. If a bit has a value of '0', then the corresponding interrupt vector is not masked. |
