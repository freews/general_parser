##### 8.1.18.5 Host Controlled Thermal Management

> **Section ID**: 8.1.18.5 | **Page**: 614-616

A controller may support host controlled thermal management (HCTM), as indicated in the Host Controlled
Thermal Management Attributes of the Identify Controller data structure in Figure 328. Host controlled
thermal management provides a mechanism for the host to configure a controller to automatically transition
between active power states or perform vendor specific thermal management actions in order to attempt to
meet thermal management requirements specified by the host. If active power states transitions are used
to attempt to meet these thermal management requirements specified by the host, then those active power
states transitions are vendor specific.
The host specifies and enables the thermal management requirements by setting the Thermal Management
Temperature 1 field and/or Thermal Management Temperature 2 field (refer to section 5.2.26.1.9) in a Set
Features command to a non-zero value. The supported range of values for the Thermal Management
Temperature 1 field and Thermal Management Temperature 2 field are indicated in the Identify Controller
data structure in Figure 328.
The Thermal Management Temperature 1 specifies that if the Composite Temperature (refer to Figure 211)
is:
a) greater than or equal to this value; and
b) less than the Thermal Management Temperature 2, if non-zero,
then the controller should start transitioning to lower power active power states or perform vendor specific
thermal management actions while minimizing the impact on performance in order to attempt to reduce the
Composite Temperature (e.g., transition to an active power state that performs light throttling).
The Thermal Management Temperature 2 field specifies that if the Composite Temperature is greater than
or equal to this value, then the controller shall start transitioning to lower power active power states or
perform vendor specific thermal management actions regardless of the impact on performance in order to
attempt to reduce the Composite Temperature (e.g., transition to an active power state that performs heavy
throttling).
If the controller is currently in a lower power active power state or performing vendor specific thermal
management actions because of this feature (e.g., throttling performance) because the Composite
Temperature is:
a) greater than or equal to the current value of the Thermal Management Temperature 1 field; and
b) less than the current value of the Thermal Management Temperature 2 field,
and the Composite Temperature decreases to a value below the current value of the Thermal Management
Temperature 1 field, then the controller should return to the active power state that the controller was in
prior to going to a lower power active power state or stop performing vendor specific thermal management
actions because of this feature, the Composite Temperature and the current value of the Thermal
Management Temperature 1 field.
If the controller is currently in a lower power active power state or performing vendor specific thermal
management actions because the Composite Temperature is greater than or equal to the current value of
the Thermal Management Temperature 2 field and the Composite Temperature decreases to a value less
than the current value of the Thermal Management Temperature 1 field, then the controller should return
to the active power state that the controller was in prior to going to a lower power active power state or stop
performing vendor specific thermal management actions because of this feature, and the Composite
Temperature.
The temperature at which the controller stops being in a lower power active power state or performing
vendor specific thermal management actions because of this feature is vendor specific (i.e., hysteresis is
vendor specific).
Figure 675 shows examples of how the Composite Temperature may be affected by this feature.
Note: Since the host controlled thermal management (HCTM) feature uses the Composite Temperature,
the actual interactions between a platform (e.g., tablet, or laptop) and two different device implementations
may vary even with the same Thermal Management Temperature 1 and Thermal Management
Temperature 2 temperature settings. The use of this feature requires validation between those devices’
implementations and the platform in order to be used effectively.
The SMART / Health Information log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.3) contains statistics related to Host
Controller Thermal Management.
