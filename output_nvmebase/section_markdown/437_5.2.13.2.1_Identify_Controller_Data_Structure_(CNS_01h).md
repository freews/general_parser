###### 5.2.13.2.1 Identify Controller Data Structure (CNS 01h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.13.2.1 | **Page**: 345-381

The Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328) is returned to the host for the controller processing
the command.
Figure 329 defines the power state descriptor that describes the attributes of each power state. For more
information on how the power state descriptor fields are used, refer to section 8.1.18 on power
management. If the controller supports the Power Limit feature (refer to section 5.2.26.1.25), then the
number and contents of the power state descriptors depends on the current attributes of that Feature as
specified in section 8.1.18.6.
