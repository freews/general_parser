#### 5.4.11 Send Discovery Log Page command

> **Section ID**: 5.4.11 | **Page**: 511-512

The Send Discovery Log Page (SDLP) command is used by a CDC to send a discovery log page to a pull
model DDC. This command uses the Data Pointer, Command Dword 10, Command Dword 11, Command
Dword 12, and Command Dword 13, as shown in Figure 567, Figure 568, Figure 569, Figure 570, and
Figure 571 respectively.
The transferred log page has the same format of the correspondent discovery log page retrieved by a Get
Log Page command (refer to section 5.2.12). The discovery log pages allowed to be transferred by a SDLP
command are shown in Figure 572.
If a not allowed log page is requested, the CDC shall set the RLPS field (refer to Figure 568) to 02h (i.e.,
Not Allowed Log Page) and transfer no log page.
The pull model DDC receiving a SDLP command may request the CDC to resend the requested log page
when that log page is updated on the CDC. This is done through the LPUR bit in Dword 0 of the completion
queue entry for the SDLP command, as shown in Figure 573.
