#### 2.3.3 NVM Subsystem Examples

> **Section ID**: 2.3.3 | **Page**: 55-57

Figure 16 illustrates a simple NVM subsystem that has a single instance of each storage entity.
•
The NVM subsystem consists of a single port and a single domain.
•
The domain contains a controller and storage media.
•
All of the storage media are contained in one Endurance Group.
•
All of the storage media in that Endurance Group are organized into one NVM Set.
•
That NVM Set contains a single namespace.
Figure 17 shows an NVM subsystem with two namespaces.
An NVM subsystem may have multiple domains, multiple namespaces, multiple controllers, and multiple
ports, as shown in Figure 18.
