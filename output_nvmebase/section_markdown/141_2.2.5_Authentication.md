#### 2.2.5 Authentication

> **Section ID**: 2.2.5 | **Page**: 49-49

NVMe over Fabrics supports both fabric secure channel that includes authentication (refer to section
8.3.5.1) and NVMe in-band authentication. An NVM subsystem may require a host to use fabric secure
channel, NVMe in-band authentication, or both. The Discovery Service indicates if fabric secure channel
shall be used for an NVM subsystem. The Connect response indicates if NVMe in-band authentication shall
be used with that controller.
A controller associated with an NVM subsystem that requires a fabric secure channel shall not accept any
commands (i.e., Fabrics commands, Admin commands, or I/O commands) on an NVMe Transport until a
secure channel is established. Following a Connect command, a controller that requires NVMe in-band
authentication shall not accept any commands on the queue created by that Connect command other than
authentication commands until NVMe in-band authentication has completed. Refer to section 8.3.5.
