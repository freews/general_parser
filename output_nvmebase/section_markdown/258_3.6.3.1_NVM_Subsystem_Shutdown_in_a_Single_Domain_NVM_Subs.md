##### 3.6.3.1 NVM Subsystem Shutdown in a Single Domain NVM Subsystem

> **Section ID**: 3.6.3.1 | **Page**: 140-141

A normal shutdown on all controllers within the NVM subsystem (i.e., normal NVM Subsystem Shutdown)
is initiated by:
•
a host writing the value 4E726D6Ch ("Nrml") to NSSD.NSSC when CAP.CPS is set to 11b; or
•
issuing an NVMe-MI Shutdown command to a Management Endpoint (refer to the NVM Express
Management Interface Specification) specifying a normal shutdown.
For each controller in the NVM subsystem for this normal NVM Subsystem Shutdown, if:
•
CSTS.SHST is set to 00b; and
•
An outstanding Asynchronous Event Request command exists,
then the controller shall issue a Normal NVM Subsystem Shutdown event prior to shutting down the
controller.
An abrupt shutdown on all controllers within the NVM subsystem (i.e., abrupt NVM Subsystem Shutdown)
is initiated by:
•
a host writing the value 41627074h ("Abpt") to NSSD.NSSC when CAP.CPS is set to 11b; or
•
issuing an NVMe-MI Shutdown command to a Management Endpoint (refer to the NVM Express
Management Interface Specification) specifying an abrupt shutdown.
While NVM Subsystem Shutdown processing is in progress, any controller in the NVM subsystem may
abort any command with a status code of Commands Aborted due to Power Loss Notification.
It is recommended that the host wait a minimum of the NVM Subsystem Shutdown Latency reported in the
Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328) for NVM Subsystem Shutdown processing to
complete; if the reported NVM Subsystem Shutdown Latency value is 0h, then the host should wait for a
minimum of 30 seconds. While an NVM Subsystem Shutdown is reported as in progress, it is not
recommended to reset the NVM subsystem via an NVM Subsystem Reset or a power cycle (which causes
an NVM Subsystem Reset). This aborts the NVM Subsystem Shutdown which may impact the subsequent
time required for the NVM subsystem to become ready to perform I/O (e.g., after power is reapplied
following a power cycle).
For either a normal or an abrupt NVM Subsystem Shutdown, the NVM subsystem is ready to be powered
off (e.g., the media is in the shutdown state (refer to Figure 85)) when the CSTS.ST bit is set to ‘1’ and the
CSTS.SHST field indicates that shutdown processing is complete (i.e., the CSTS.SHST field is set to 10b)
on any controller in the NVM subsystem. The NVM subsystem shall not set the CSTS.SHST field to 10b on
any controller in the NVM subsystem until the entire NVM subsystem is ready to be powered off. The NVM
Subsystem shall indicate that NVM Subsystem Shutdown processing is complete by setting the
CSTS.SHST field to 10b on all controllers in the NVM subsystem. The NVM subsystem remains ready to
be powered off (e.g., the media remains in the shutdown state) until:
A. an NVM Subsystem Reset; or
B. an Admin command that requires access to the media (refer to Figure 84) and specifies the Ignore
Shutdown bit set to ‘1’ is processed by any controller via the out-of-band mechanism (refer to the
NVM Express Management Interface Specification).
If a normal or an abrupt NVM Subsystem Shutdown is reported as in progress or is reported as complete
within the NVM subsystem (i.e., the CSTS.ST bit is set to ‘1’ and the CSTS.SHST field is set to either 01b
or 10b on all controllers in the NVM subsystem, indicating that an NVM Subsystem Reset has not occurred
since initiation of that NVM Subsystem Shutdown), then:
•
an NVM Subsystem Reset:
o
shall abort any in progress NVM Subsystem Shutdown;
o
clears the CSTS.SHST field to 00b in all controllers in the NVM subsystem; and
o
clears the CSTS.ST bit to ‘0’ in all controllers in the NVM subsystem;
and
•
a Controller Level Reset of any controller in the NVM subsystem that is initiated by any other
method (refer to section 3.7.2):
o
shall not abort any in progress NVM Subsystem Shutdown;
o
does not change the values of the CSTS.ST bit and the CSTS.SHST field, as described in
Figure 42; and
o
shall not cause that NVM subsystem to cease being ready to be powered off (e.g., shall
not transition the media out of the shutdown state) if that NVM Subsystem was ready to be
powered off when that Controller Level Reset was initiated.
To start executing commands on the controller after that controller reports NVM Subsystem Shutdown
processing complete (i.e., the CSTS.ST bit is set to ‘1’ and the CSTS.SHST field is set to 10b):
•
regardless of the value of the CC.EN bit, an NVM Subsystem Reset is required; and
•
the CC.EN bit is subsequently required to be set to ‘1’ as part of the initialization sequence (refer
to section 3.5).
The initialization sequence (refer to section 3.5) should then be executed on that controller.
