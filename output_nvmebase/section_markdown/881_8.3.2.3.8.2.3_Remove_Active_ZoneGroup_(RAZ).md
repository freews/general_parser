###### 8.3.2.3.8.2.3 Remove Active ZoneGroup (RAZ)

> **Section ID**: 8.3.2.3.8.2.3 | **Page**: 722-723

The Remove Active ZoneGroup (RAZ) operation allows a DDC to remove from the CDC an active
ZoneGroup associated with the DDC initiating the RAZ operation. For a push model DDC, the RAZ
operation is mapped to an FZL command to provide to the CDC with the identifier of the ZoneGroup to
remove, as shown in Figure 761.
The identifier of the ZoneGroup to remove is provided in the FZL buffer, as shown in Figure 762.
For the FZS command of an RAZ request operation:
•
if the requested ZoneGroup does not exist on the CDC, then the CDC shall abort the command
with a status code of Zoning Data Structure Not Found; or
•
if the requested ZoneGroup is locked on the CDC (i.e., another administrative interface is modifying
that ZoneGroup), then the CDC shall abort the command with a status code of Zoning Data
Structure Locked.
The CDC may enforce access restrictions to the Zoning data structures. In this case, the CDC shall check
if the DDC issuing the FZL command is authorized to remove the ZoneGroup specified in the FZL data
(e.g., if the CDC allows access to a ZoneGroup only to the DDC that created that ZoneGroup, verify that
the ZoneGroup Originator field matches the NQN contained in the HOSTNQN field of the Connect
command sent from the DDC to that CDC). If that DDC is not authorized to access the specified ZoneGroup,
then the CDC shall abort the FZL command with a status code of ZoneGroup Originator Invalid.
