###### 3.3.2.1.3.2 Data Transfer Examples

> **Section ID**: 3.3.2.1.3.2 | **Page**: 117-118

The data transfer examples in Figure 78 and Figure 79 show SGL examples for a Write command where
data is transferred via a memory transaction or within the capsule. The SGL may use a key as part of the
data transfer depending on the requirements of the NVMe Transport used.
The first example shows an 8KiB write where all of the data is transferred via memory transactions. In this
case, there is one SGL descriptor that is contained within the submission queue entry at CMD.SGL1. The
SGL descriptor is a Keyed SGL Data Block descriptor. If more SGLs are required to complete the command,
the additional SGLs are contained in the command capsule.
The second example shows an 8KiB write where all of the data is transferred within the capsule. In this
case, the SGL descriptor is an SGL Data Block descriptor specifying an Offset of 20h based on an ICDOFF
value of 2h.
