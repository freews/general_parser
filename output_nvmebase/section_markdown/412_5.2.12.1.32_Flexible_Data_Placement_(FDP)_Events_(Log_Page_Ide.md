###### 5.2.12.1.32 Flexible Data Placement (FDP) Events (Log Page Identifier 23h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.32 | **Page**: 310-312

The FDP Events log page is used to provide information about events affecting Reclaim Units and media
usage in an Endurance Group that has Flexible Data Placement enabled. The log page is 4 KiB bytes in
size. The Endurance Group is specified by the Endurance Group Identifier in the Log Specific Identifier field
as defined in Figure 221.
FDP events are associated with Reclaim Unit Handles. An FDP event shall only be reported if the FDP
event occurs and that FDP event is enabled for that Reclaim Unit Handle (refer to section 5.2.26.1.21).
If:
•
an FDP event occurs;
•
that event is enabled; and
•
the number of events recorded is the maximum supported,
then the oldest event shall be discarded.
The FDP Event Type bit (refer to Figure 294) specifies whether the controller reports host events or
controller events in the log page. The controller shall not report both host events and controller events in
the log page.
If Flexible Data Placement is enabled in the specified Endurance Group and a Get Log Page command
specifies this log page, then the NSID field in that command is reserved.
If Flexible Data Placement is disabled in the specified Endurance Group, then a Get Log Page command
that specifies this log page shall be aborted with a status code of FDP Disabled.
The FDP events shall be listed in ascending order of occurrence. Because the Timestamp feature may or
may not have been set by the host after each Controller Level Reset and because the Event Timestamp
field is the time at which the event was created, the FDP events may or may not be in order of ascending
value of the Event Timestamp field.
The number of FDP events reported in the log page is equal to the value of the Number of FDP Events
field. The values of the bytes in this log page which follow the FDP Event List is implementation specific.
The format of the FDP event is described in Figure 296.
If the controller is not able to report the namespace identifier associated with the event, then the NSIDV bit
shall be cleared to ‘0’.
If the controller is not able to report the specific Reclaim Unit Handle, then:
•
the PIV bit shall be cleared to ‘0’; and
•
the LV bit shall be cleared to ‘0’.
