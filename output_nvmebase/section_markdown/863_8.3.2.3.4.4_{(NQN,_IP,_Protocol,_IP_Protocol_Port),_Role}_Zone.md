> **Section ID**: 8.3.2.3.4.4 | **Page**: 713-714

This Zone member type identifies a specific fabric interface (i.e., through the IP address), the specific IP
protocol (e.g., TCP), and IP protocol port (e.g., TCP port 4420) used by the NVMe-oF entity identified by
the Zone member’s NQN over that fabric interface. The format of this Zone member type is shown in Figure
