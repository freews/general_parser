###### 8.3.2.3.4.4 {(NQN, IP, Protocol, IP Protocol Port), Role} Zone Member Type (Type 3h)

> **Section ID**: 8.3.2.3.4.4 | **Page**: 713-714

This Zone member type identifies a specific fabric interface (i.e., through the IP address), the specific IP
protocol (e.g., TCP), and IP protocol port (e.g., TCP port 4420) used by the NVMe-oF entity identified by
the Zone member’s NQN over that fabric interface. The format of this Zone member type is shown in Figure
745.

| Bytes | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 00 | **Zone Member Type (ZMTYPE):** This field specifies the Zone member type and shall be set to 3h. |
| 02:01 | **Zone Member Length (ZMLEN):** This field specifies the length in bytes of this Zone member type and shall be set to 100. |
| 03 | **Zone Member Role (ZMROLE):** This field specifies what type of entity the Zone member is. This field shall be set to one of the following values: <br> • 1h: host; or <br> • 2h: NVM subsystem. |

| Bytes | Description |
| 04 | **Zone Member Address Family (ZMADRFAM):** This field specifies the IP address family. This field shall be set to one of the following values: <br> • 1h: IPv4 address family; or <br> • 2h: IPv6 address family. |
| 05 | **Zone Member IP Protocol (ZMIPPROTO):** This field specifies the IP protocol. This field shall be set to one of the following values: <br> • 6h: TCP; or <br> • 11h: UDP. |
| 07:06 | **Zone Member Transport Service Identifier (ZMTRSVCID):** This field specifies the TCP or UDP port. |
| 23:08 | **Zone Member Transport Address (ZMTRADDR):** This field specifies the IP address. An IPv6 address is encoded in binary as follows: <br> <table> <tr> <th>Bytes</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>00:00</td> <td>IPv6 Address (IPV6ADDR): This field contains an IPv6 address.</td> </tr> </table> <br> An IPv4 address is encoded in binary as follows: <br> <table> <tr> <th>Bytes</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>03:00</td> <td>IPv4 Address (IPV4ADDR): This field contains an IPv4 address.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>15:04</td> <td>Reserved</td> </tr> </table> |
| 31:24 | |
| 255:32 | **Zone Member NQN (ZMNQN):** This field specifies the NQN (represented as a null-terminated string, NULL padded as necessary to the 224-byte maximum length) of the referenced NVMe-oF entity, |
