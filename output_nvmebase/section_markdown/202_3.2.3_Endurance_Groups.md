#### 3.2.3 Endurance Groups

> **Section ID**: 3.2.3 | **Page**: 105-106

Endurance may be managed within a single NVM Set (refer to section 3.2.2) or across a collection of NVM
Sets. Each NVM Set is associated with an Endurance Group (refer to Figure 333). If two or more NVM Sets
have the same Endurance Group Identifier, then endurance is managed by the NVM subsystem across
that collection of NVM Sets. If only one NVM Set is associated with a specific Endurance Group Identifier,
then endurance is managed locally to that NVM Set.
If NVM Sets are not supported, then endurance is managed by the NVM subsystem:
•
within each Endurance Group if Endurance Groups are supported; or
•
within the domain if Endurance Groups are not supported.
An Endurance Group shall be part of only one domain (refer to section 3.2.5).
An Endurance Group Identifier is a 16-bit value that specifies the Endurance Group with which an action is
associated. An Endurance Group Identifier is unique within the NVM subsystem. An Endurance Group
Identifier value of 0h is reserved and is not a valid Endurance Group Identifier. Unless otherwise specified,
if the host specifies an Endurance Group Identifier cleared to 0h for a command that requires an Endurance
Group Identifier, then that command shall abort with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.
The information that describes an Endurance Group is indicated in the Endurance Group Information log
page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.10).
Figure 69 shows Endurance Groups added to the example in Figure 67. In this example, the endurance of
NVM Set A and NVM Set B are managed together as part of Endurance Group Y, while the endurance of
NVM Set C is managed only within NVM Set C which is the only NVM Set that is part of Endurance Group
Z.
If Endurance Groups are supported, then the NVM subsystem and all controllers shall:
•
indicate support for Endurance Groups in the Controller Attributes field in the Identify Controller
data structure;
•
indicate the Endurance Group Identifier with which the namespace is associated in the Identify
Namespace data structure;
•
support the Endurance Group Information log page; and
•
support the Endurance Group Event Aggregate log page if more than one Endurance Group is
supported in the NVM subsystem.
If Endurance Groups are not supported and the host sends a command in which an Endurance Group
Identifier field is defined (e.g., Get Log Page), then that field shall be ignored by the controller.
If Endurance Groups are not supported and the controller returns information to the host that contains an
Endurance Group Identifier field, then that field shall be cleared to 0h.
