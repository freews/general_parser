##### 3.1.3.6 Feature Support Requirements

> **Section ID**: 3.1.3.6 | **Page**: 73-75

Figure 32 defines features that are mandatory, optional, and prohibited for an I/O controller, Administrative
controller, and Discovery controller. If any feature is supported, then the Set Features command and the
Get Features command shall be supported. I/O Command Set specific feature support requirements are
described within NVM Express I/O Command Set specifications.

| Notes: | | | | | | |
| 1. O/M/P definition: O = Optional, M = Mandatory, P = Prohibited | | | | | | |
| 2. Mandatory for NVMe over PCIe. This feature is not supported for NVMe over Fabrics. | | | | | | |
| 3. Mandatory if reservations are supported as indicated in the Identify Controller data structure. | | | | | | |
| 4. Mandatory if reservations are supported as indicated by a non-zero value in the Reservation Capabilities (RESCAP) field in the Identify Namespaces data structure. | | | | | | |
| 5. Optional for NVMe subsystems that do not implement a Management Endpoint. For NVMe subsystems that implement any Management Endpoint refer to the NVM Express Management Interface Specification. | | | | | | |
| 6. Mandatory for controllers that support the Flexible Data Placement capability (refer to section 8.1.11). Refer to the FDPS bit in Figure 328. | | | | | | |
| 7. Optional if not required by the NVMe Transport (refer to section 3.9). | | | | | | |
| 8. Mandatory if Telemetry Log, Firmware Commit or SMART / Health Critical Warnings are supported. | | | | | | |
| 9. Prohibited for an Exported NVMe Subsystem (refer to section 8.3.4). | | | | | | |
| 10. For Discovery controllers that support explicit persistent connections, this feature is mandatory. For Discovery controllers that do not support explicit persistent connections, this feature is prohibited. | | | | | | |
