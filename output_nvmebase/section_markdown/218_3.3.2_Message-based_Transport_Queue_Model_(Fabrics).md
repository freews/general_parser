#### 3.3.2 Message-based Transport Queue Model (Fabrics)

> **Section ID**: 3.3.2 | **Page**: 114-115

For NVMe over Fabrics, a queue is a unidirectional communication channel that is used to send capsules
between a host and a controller. A host uses Submission Queues to send command capsules (refer to
section 3.3.2.1.1) to a controller. A controller uses Completion Queues to send response capsules (refer to
section 3.3.2.1.2) to a host. Submission and Completion Queues are created in pairs using the Connect
command (refer to section 3.3.2.2).
The NVMe Transport is responsible for delivering command capsules to the controller and notifying the
controller of capsule arrival in a transport-specific fashion.
Altering a command capsule between host submission to the Submission Queue and transport delivery of
that capsule to the controller results in undefined behavior.
NVMe Transports are not required to provide any additional end-to-end flow control. Specific NVMe
Transports may require low level flow control for congestion avoidance and reliability; any such additional
NVMe Transport flow control is outside the scope of this specification.
Flow control differs for Submission Queues (refer to section 3.3.2.1.1, section 3.3.2.6, and section 3.3.2.7)
and Completion Queues (refer to section 3.3.2.1.2, section 3.3.2.8, and section 3.3.1.2.1).
