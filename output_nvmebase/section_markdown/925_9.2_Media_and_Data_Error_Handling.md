### 9.2 Media and Data Error Handling

> **Section ID**: 9.2 | **Page**: 766-766

In the event that the requested operation could not be performed to the NVM media, the particular command
is completed with a media error indicating the type of failure using the appropriate status code.
If a read error occurs during the processing of a command, (e.g., End-to-end Guard Check Error,
Unrecovered Read Error), the controller may either stop the DMA transfer into the memory or transfer the
erroneous data to the memory. The host shall ignore the data in the memory locations for commands that
complete with such error conditions.
If a write error occurs during the processing of a command, (e.g., an internal error, End-to-end Guard Check
Error, End-to-end Application Tag Check Error), the controller may either stop or complete the DMA
transfer.
Additional I/O Command Set specific error handling is described within applicable NVM Express I/O
Command Set specifications.
