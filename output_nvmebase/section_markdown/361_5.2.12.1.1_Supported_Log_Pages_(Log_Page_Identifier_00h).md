###### 5.2.12.1.1 Supported Log Pages (Log Page Identifier 00h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.1 | **Page**: 235-235

An NVM subsystem may support several interfaces for submitting a Get Log Page command such as an
Admin Submission Queue, PCIe VDM Management Endpoint, or 2-Wire Management Endpoint (refer to
the NVM Express Management Interface Specification for details on Management Endpoints) and may
have zero or more instances of each of those interfaces. The log pages supported on each instance of each
interface may be different. This log page is used to describe the log pages that are supported on the
interface to which the Get Log Page command was submitted and attributes specific to each log page. The
log page is defined in Figure 207. The attributes of each log page are described in a LID Supported and
Effects data structure defined in Figure 208.
If the UUID Selection Supported bit is set to ‘1’ for the Get Log Page command in the Commands Supported
and Effects log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.6), then the log page data reflects the log pages that are
supported based on the value of the UUID Index field (refer to section 8.1.30).
For controllers that implement I/O Queues, the log pages that the controller supports are dependent on the
I/O Command Set that is based on:
•
the I/O Command Set selected in CC.CSS, if CC.CSS is not set to 110b; and
•
the Command Set Identifier (CSI) field in CDW 14, if CC.CSS is set to 110b.
