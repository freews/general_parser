###### 5.2.12.1.1 Supported Log Pages (Log Page Identifier 00h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.1 | **Page**: 235-235

An NVM subsystem may support several interfaces for submitting a Get Log Page command such as an
Admin Submission Queue, PCIe VDM Management Endpoint, or 2-Wire Management Endpoint (refer to
the NVM Express Management Interface Specification for details on Management Endpoints) and may
have zero or more instances of each of those interfaces. The log pages supported on each instance of each
interface may be different. This log page is used to describe the log pages that are supported on the
interface to which the Get Log Page command was submitted and attributes specific to each log page. The
log page is defined in Figure 207. The attributes of each log page are described in a LID Supported and
Effects data structure defined in Figure 208.
If the UUID Selection Supported bit is set to ‘1’ for the Get Log Page command in the Commands Supported
and Effects log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.6), then the log page data reflects the log pages that are
supported based on the value of the UUID Index field (refer to section 8.1.30).
For controllers that implement I/O Queues, the log pages that the controller supports are dependent on the
I/O Command Set that is based on:
•
the I/O Command Set selected in CC.CSS, if CC.CSS is not set to 110b; and
•
the Command Set Identifier (CSI) field in CDW 14, if CC.CSS is set to 110b.

| Bytes | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 3:0 | Log Page Identifier Supported 0 (LIDS0): Contains the LID Supported and Effects data structure (refer to Figure 208) for the LID 0h. |
| 7:4 | Log Page Identifier Supported 1 (LIDS1): Contains the LID Supported and Effects data structure (refer to Figure 208) for the LID 1h. |
| ... | ... |
| 1019:1016 | Log Page Identifier Supported 254 (LIDS254): Contains the LID Supported and Effects data structure (refer to Figure 208) for the LID FFh. |
| 1023:1020 | Log Page Identifier Supported 255 (LIDS255): Contains the LID Supported and Effects data structure (refer to Figure 208) for the LID FFh. |
| Bits | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 31:16 | LID Specific Parameter (LIDSP): This field is specific to the log page identifier and if not defined for the log specified by the Log Page Identifier field, this field is reserved. |
| 15:2 | |
| 1 | Index Offset Supported (IOS): If this bit is set to '1', then the controller supports an index offset for this LID in a Get Log Page command (i.e., the OT bit in the Get Log Page command is allowed to be set to '1'). If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller does not support an index offset for this LID in a Get Log Page command (i.e., the OT bit in the Get Log Page command is only allowed to be cleared to '0').<br>If the controller does not support extended data for the Get Log Page command (refer to the Log Page Extended Data Support (SPEDS) bit in the LPA field in Figure 328), then this bit shall be cleared to '0'. |
| 0 | LID Supported (LSUPP): If this bit is set to '1', then the controller supports this LID for a Get Log Page command. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller does not support this LID for a Get Log Page command, and the host should ignore other fields in this data structure.<br>Refer to section 3.1.3.5 for the LID support requirements for each controller type. |
