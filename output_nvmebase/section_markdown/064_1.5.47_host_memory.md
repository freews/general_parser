#### 1.5.47 host memory

> **Section ID**: 1.5.47 | **Page**: 33-33

Memory that may be read and written by both a host and a controller and that is not exposed by a controller
(i.e., Controller Memory Buffer or Persistent Memory Region). Host memory may be implemented inside or
outside a host (e.g., a memory region exposed by a device that is neither the host nor controller).
