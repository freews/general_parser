###### 8.3.2.3.4.7 {(NQN, Protocol, PortID, ADRFAM), Role} Zone Member Type (Type 6h)

> **Section ID**: 8.3.2.3.4.7 | **Page**: 715-716

This Zone member type identifies the specific IP protocol (e.g., TCP), PortID, and Address Family used by
the NVMe-oF entity identified by the Zone member’s NQN over that fabric interface. The format of this Zone
member type is shown in Figure 748.
