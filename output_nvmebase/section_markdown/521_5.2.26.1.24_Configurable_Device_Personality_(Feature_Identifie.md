###### 5.2.26.1.24 Configurable Device Personality (Feature Identifier 22h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.24 | **Page**: 446-449

This Feature controls the operation of the Configurable Device Personality (CDP) capability (refer to section
8.1.6). The Set Features command allows a host to change the settings of a device personality in the NVM
subsystem and the Get Features command allows a host to discover the settings for a device personality.
Figure 447 defines personalities that are able to be supported by an NVM subsystem. Each personality
may have multiple configurations.
The attributes for this Feature are specified in Command Dword 13 (refer to Figure 448). The effects on an
NVM subsystem as a result of making a change to the settings of the specified personality are described
in section 8.1.6.
The Set Features command and the Get Features command may transfer additional data in the command
data buffer as defined by each personality (refer to Figure 447).
If a Get Features command completes successfully for this Feature, then:
•
the current attributes for the personality specified by the PERID field in that Get Features command
shall be returned in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command (refer to Figure 449);
and
•
if the personality specified in the PERID field in Command Dword 13 defines settings in the data
buffer (as indicated in Figure 447), then those personality settings shall correspond to the current
settings for that personality.
If a personality that is not supported (refer to Figure 285) is specified in the PERID field in Command Dword
13, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.
If the personality (i.e., the PERID field in Command Dword 13) is set to the All Personalities value (i.e., FFh)
and the Change Personality Settings (CHPS) bit is set to ‘1’ for a Set Features command, then the controller
shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.
This Feature is not saveable and is persistent (refer to Figure 396). The settings for each personality shall
persist across power cycles and resets unless modified by the mechanisms described in this section.
A personality is able to be frozen. If a personality is frozen, then the settings of that personality are not
allowed to be changed. If an authentication method is supported by that personality, as described in section
5.2.26.1.24.1, then that frozen personality is able to be unfrozen. If no authentication method is supported
by that personality, then that frozen personality is permanently frozen.
NVM Express does not provide any guidance on whether modifying the NVM subsystem by changing the
settings of a personality affects compliance with any applicable laws, specifications, or other requirements.
