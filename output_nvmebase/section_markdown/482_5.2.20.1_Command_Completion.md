##### 5.2.20.1 Command Completion

> **Section ID**: 5.2.20.1 | **Page**: 412-413

When the command is completed, the controller posts a completion queue entry to the Admin Completion
Queue indicating the status for the command.
Command specific status values associated with the Namespace Attachment command are defined in
Figure 381. For failures, the byte offset of the first failing entry is reported in the Command Specific
Information field of the Error Information Log Entry. The controller does not process further entries in the
Controller List after an error is encountered.
