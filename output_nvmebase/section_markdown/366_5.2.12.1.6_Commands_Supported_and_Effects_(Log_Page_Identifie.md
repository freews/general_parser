###### 5.2.12.1.6 Commands Supported and Effects (Log Page Identifier 05h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.6 | **Page**: 244-246

This log page is used to describe the commands that the controller supports and the effects of those
commands on the state of the NVM subsystem. The log page is 4,096 bytes in size. There is one
Commands Supported and Effects data structure per Admin command opcode value. For controllers that
implement I/O Queues, there is one Commands Supported and Effects data structure per I/O command
opcode value for a specified I/O Command Set based on:
a) the I/O Command Set selected in CC.CSS, if CC.CSS is not set to 110b; and
b) the Command Set Identifier field in CDW 14, if CC.CSS is set to 110b.
The Commands Supported and Effects data structure describes the overall possible effect of a command
including any optional features of the command.
The host may take command effects into account when determining how to submit commands and actions
to take after the command is complete. It is recommended that if a command may change a particular
capability that the host re-enumerate and/or re-initialize the associated capability after the command is
complete. For example, if a namespace capability change may occur, then the host is recommended to
pause the use of the associated namespace, submit the command that may cause a namespace capability
change and wait for its completion, and then re-issue the Identify command.
If the namespace is attached to multiple controllers, the host(s) associated with those controllers should
coordinate their commands to meet the Command Submission and Execution requirements (refer to Figure
214). The details of this coordination are outside the scope of this specification.
