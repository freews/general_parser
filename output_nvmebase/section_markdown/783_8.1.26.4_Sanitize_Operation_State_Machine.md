##### 8.1.26.4 Sanitize Operation State Machine

> **Section ID**: 8.1.26.4 | **Page**: 661-662

The Sanitize Operation State Machine (refer to Figure 706) defines the state of sanitization of a sanitization
target. There is one instance of the state machine for each supported sanitization target (i.e., one for the
NVM subsystem if an NVM subsystem sanitize operation is supported, and one for each allocated
namespace if a namespace sanitize operation is supported). The label on each transition begins with a
letter and may include a number. The letter indicates the condition causing that transition, as described in
the section for each state. The number differentiates between different transitions that have the same
transition condition.
In the state transitions described in this section, asynchronous events are reported as described in section
8.1.26.1. In the completion queue entry for the Asynchronous Event Request command:
•
for Dword 0 (refer to Figure 150):
a) the Log Page Identifier field shall be set to 81h (i.e., Sanitize Status log page);
b) the Asynchronous Event Information field (refer to section 5.2.2.1) shall be set to:
01h (i.e., Sanitize Operation Completed);
02h (i.e., Sanitize Operation Completed With Unexpected Deallocation); or
03h (i.e., Sanitize Operation Entered Media Verification State);
and
c) the Asynchronous Event Type field shall be set to 110b (i.e., I/O Command specific status);
and
for Dword 1, as specified in section 8.1.26.1, the Event Specific Parameter (refer to Figure 151)
set to the NSID for the sanitization target. For a sanitization target of the NVM subsystem, the NSI
value reported is cleared to 0h.
In each state transition described in this section, the controller shall set the Sanitize State (SANS) field in
the Sanitize Status log page for the sanitization target to the value corresponding to the state being entered.
