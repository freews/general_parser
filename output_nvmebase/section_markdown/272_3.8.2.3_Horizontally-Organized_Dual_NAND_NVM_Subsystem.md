##### 3.8.2.3 Horizontally-Organized Dual NAND NVM Subsystem

> **Section ID**: 3.8.2.3 | **Page**: 148-149

Figure 88 shows an example of a single domain NVM subsystem where the Media Units are NAND which
is capable of being operated as QLC or at a lower density. The performance goal is for maximum bandwidth
to a small NVM Set operating as SLC and to a larger NVM Set operating as QLC.
The Capacity Configuration Descriptor for this example contains two Endurance Group Configuration
Descriptors. The first Endurance Group Configuration Descriptor for this example:
•
indicates a Capacity Adjustment Factor of approximately 400;
•
contains one NVM Set Identifier; and
•
contains four Channel Configuration Descriptors. Each Channel Configuration Descriptor contains
one Media Unit Configuration Descriptor.
The second Endurance Group Configuration Descriptor for this example:
•
indicates a Capacity Adjustment Factor of 100;
•
contains one NVM Set Identifier; and
•
contains four Channel Configuration Descriptors. Each Channel Configuration Descriptor contains
three Media Unit Configuration Descriptors.
