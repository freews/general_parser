##### 5.2.2.1 Command Completion

> **Section ID**: 5.2.2.1 | **Page**: 203-209

A completion queue entry is posted to the Admin Completion Queue if there is an asynchronous event to
report to the host. Command specific status values associated with Asynchronous Event Request are
defined in Figure 149.
Dword 0 and Dword 1 of the completion queue entry contains information about the asynchronous event.
The definition of Dword 0 of the completion queue entry is in Figure 150. The definition of Dword 1 of the
completion queue entry is in Figure 151.
