##### 8.1.2.2 Host ANA Inaccessible Operation

> **Section ID**: 8.1.2.2 | **Page**: 546-546

If the ANA log page reports an ANA state of ANA Inaccessible State for an ANA Group or a command
returns a status code of Asymmetric Access Inaccessible, then the host should:
•
not use that controller to send commands to any namespace in that ANA Group; and
•
select a different controller for sending commands to all namespaces in that ANA Group.
If there are no controllers that report the ANA Optimized state for a namespace and there are no controllers
that report the ANA Non-Optimized state, then a transition may be occurring that also impacts controllers
that are reporting the ANA Inaccessible state. As a result, the host should use the methods described for
Host ANA Transition operation (refer to section 8.1.2.5) to determine if the controller reporting ANA
Inaccessible state transitions during the ANATT time interval to an ANA state that enables commands to
be processed by that controller.
