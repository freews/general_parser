###### 5.2.13.2.4 NVM Set List (CNS 04h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.13.2.4 | **Page**: 382-383

Figure 333 defines an NVM Set List. The data structure is an ordered list of NVM Set Attribute Entry data
structures, sorted by NVM Set Identifier, starting with the first NVM Set Identifier supported by the NVM
subsystem that is equal to or greater than the NVM Set Identifier specified by the CNS Specific Identifier
field as defined in Figure 332 and are accessible by the controller processing the command. The NVM Set
List describes the attributes for each NVM Set in the list based on the NVM Set Attributes Entry in Figure
333.
The NVM Set List shall not contain an entry cleared to 0h.
