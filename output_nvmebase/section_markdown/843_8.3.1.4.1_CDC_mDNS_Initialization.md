###### 8.3.1.4.1 CDC mDNS Initialization

> **Section ID**: 8.3.1.4.1 | **Page**: 702-702

During initialization (e.g., following a link transition or power cycle), before the CDC’s mDNS responder
function is enabled, the CDC shall probe to ensure the unique resource records the CDC are responsible
for are unique on the local link (refer to section 8.1 in RFC 6762).
Upon successful completion of the probe, the CDC shall announce (refer to section 8.2 in RFC 6762) its
newly registered resource records.
Upon announcing its resource records, the CDC’s mDNS responder function may be enabled and respond
to queries for the service name of “_cdc._sub._nvme-disc._<protocol>.local” as described in section
8.3.1.4.5.
A CDC should query for the presence of another CDC as defined in section 8.3.1.4.3 and process
responses as defined in section 8.3.1.4.4.
