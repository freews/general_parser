###### 5.2.12.1.18 Feature Identifiers Supported and Effects (Log Page Identifier 12h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.18 | **Page**: 291-293

An NVM subsystem may support several interfaces for submitting a Get Log Page command such as an
Admin Submission Queue, PCIe VDM Management Endpoint, or 2-Wire Management Endpoint (refer the
NVM Express Management Interface Specification for details on Management Endpoints) and may have
zero or more instances of each of those interfaces. The feature identifiers (FIDs) supported on each
instance of each interface may be different. This log page describes the FIDs that are supported on the
interface to which the Get Log Page command was submitted and the effects of those features on the state
of the NVM subsystem. The log page is defined in Figure 266. Each Feature Identifier’s effects are
described in a FID Supported and Effects data structure defined in Figure 267.
If the UUID Selection Supported bit is set to ‘1’ for the Get Log Page command in the Commands Supported
and Effects log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.6), then the log page data reflects the FIDs that are supported
based on the value of the UUID Index field (refer to section 8.1.30).
If the Feature Identifiers Supported and Effects log page is supported and the Feature is supported, then
the scope, as defined in Figure 403, shall be indicated in the FID Scope field (FSP) for that Feature (refer
to Figure 267).
For controllers that implement I/O Queues, the features that the controller supports are dependent on the
I/O Command Set that is based on:
•
the I/O Command Set selected in CC.CSS, if CC.CSS is not set to 110b; and
•
the Command Set Identifier (CSI) field in CDW 14, if CC.CSS is set to 110b.
If CC.CSS is set to 110b, I/O Command Sets that have not been enabled by the I/O Command Set Profile
(FID 19h) (refer to section 5.2.26.1.17) are treated as unsupported.
The FID Supported and Effects data structure describes the effect of a Set Features command for the FID,
including any optional features of the FID.
