###### 5.2.26.1.12 Predictable Latency Mode Config (Feature Identifier 13h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.12 | **Page**: 436-437

This Feature configures an NVM Set to use Predictable Latency Mode, including warning event thresholds.
Predictable Latency Mode and events are disabled by default. The attributes are specified in Command
Dword 11, Command Dword 12, and the Deterministic Threshold Configuration data structure.
The NVM Set has transitioned to Predictable Latency Mode when the controller completes a Set Features
command successfully with the Predictable Latency Enable bit in Command Dword 12 set to ‘1’. A transition
to the Predictable Latency Mode may be delayed (i.e., the Set Features command completion is delayed)
if the NVM subsystem needs to perform background operations on the NVM in order to operate in
Predictable Latency Mode. Upon successful completion of this command, the controller shall be in the Non-
Deterministic Window.
If a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure 422 are returned
in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command and the Deterministic Threshold Configuration
data structure is returned.
Predictable Latency Events (refer to section 5.2.12.1.12) are configured as described in Figure 423.

| Bits | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 31:16 | Reserved |
| 15:00 | NVM Set Identifier (NVMSETID): This field specifies the NVM Set to be modified. |
| | |
| Bits | Description |
| 31:01 | Reserved |
| 00 | Predictable Latency Enable (LPE): If this bit is set to '1', then Predictable Latency Mode (refer to section 8.1.19) is enabled for the NVM Set specified. If this bit is cleared to '0', then Predictable Latency Mode is disabled for the NVM Set specified. |
| | |
| Bytes | Description |
| 01:00 | Enable Event (ENEV): This field specifies whether an entry shall be added to the Predictable Latency Event Aggregate log page for the associated event. If a bit is set to '1', then an entry shall be added if the specified event occurs. If a bit is cleared to '0', then an entry shall not be added if the specified event occurs. |

| | Bits | Description |
| | 15 | Deterministic Excursion (DTE): Autonomous transition from DTWIN to NDWIN due to Deterministic Excursion. |
| | 14 | Exceeded Value (EXV): Autonomous transition from DTWIN to NDWIN due to typical or maximum value exceeded. |
| | 13:03 | Reserved |
| | 02 | DTWIN Time Warning (DTTW) |
| | 01 | DTWIN Writes Warning (DTWW) |
| | 00 | DTWIN Reads Warning (DTRW) |
| 31:02 | Reserved |
| 39:32 | DTWIN Reads Threshold (DTRT): If the value of DTWIN Reads Estimate falls below this value and the DTWIN Reads Warning is enabled, then the 'DTWIN Reads Warning' event is set in the Predictable Latency Per NVM Set log page for the affected NVM Set. |
| 47:40 | DTWIN Writes Threshold (DTWT): If the value of DTWIN Writes Estimate falls below this value and the DTWIN Writes Warning is enabled, then the 'DTWIN Writes Warning' event is set in the Predictable Latency Per NVM Set log page for the affected NVM Set. |
| 55:48 | DTWIN Time Threshold (DTTT): If the value of DTWIN Time Estimate falls below this value and the DTWIN Time Warning is enabled, then the 'DTWIN Time Warning' event is set in the Predictable Latency Per NVM Set log page for the affected NVM Set. |
