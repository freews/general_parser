##### 8.1.29.1 Telemetry Data Collection Examples (Informative)

> **Section ID**: 8.1.29.1 | **Page**: 677-679

This section includes several examples of Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Areas for illustration. The same
concepts apply to the Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Areas.
If a Telemetry Host-Initiated log page has no data for collection, then the following fields are all cleared to
0h:
•
Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 1 Last Block = 0;
•
Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 2 Last Block = 0; and
•
Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 3 Last Block = 0.
When all three telemetry data areas are populated, then the Telemetry Host-Initiated log page has different
values in each of the Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area n Last Block fields. For example, the following
values correspond to the layout shown in Figure 714:
•
Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 1 Last Block = 65;
•
Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 2 Last Block = 1,000; and
•
Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 3 Last Block = 30,000.
As a result of telemetry data areas being made up of a single set of Telemetry Data Blocks starting at
Telemetry Data Block 1, the telemetry data contained in Telemetry Data Block 1 through Telemetry Data
Block 65 of data area 1, data area 2, and data area 3 is the same. In addition, the telemetry data contained
in Telemetry Data Block 66 through Telemetry Data Block 1,000 of data area 2 and data area 3 is the same.
When only the second data area is populated, then the Telemetry Host-Initiated log page has no data in
Telemetry Data Area 1 shown by having its corresponding last block value cleared to 0h, and no additional
data in Telemetry Data Area 3 shown by having its corresponding last block value set to the same value as
the last block value for Telemetry Data Area 2. For example, the following values correspond to the layout
shown in Figure 715:
•
Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 1 Last Block = 0;
•
Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 2 Last Block = 1,000; and
•
Telemetry Host-Initiated Data Area 3 Last Block = 1,000.
As a result of telemetry data areas being made up of a single set of Telemetry Data Blocks starting at
Telemetry Data Block 1, the telemetry data contained in Telemetry Data Block 1 through Telemetry Data
Block 1,000 of data area of data area 2 and data area 3 is the same.
