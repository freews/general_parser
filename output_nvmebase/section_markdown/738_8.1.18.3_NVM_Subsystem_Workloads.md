##### 8.1.18.3 NVM Subsystem Workloads

> **Section ID**: 8.1.18.3 | **Page**: 613-614

The workload values described in this section may specify a workload hint in the Power Management
Feature (refer to section 5.2.26.1.2) to inform the NVM subsystem or indicate the conditions for the active
power level.
Active power values in the power state descriptors are specified for a particular workload since they may
vary based on the workload of the NVM subsystem. The workload field indicates the conditions to observe
the energy values. If Active Power is indicated for a power state, a corresponding workload shall also be
indicated.
The workload values are described in Figure 674.

| Value | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| 000b | **No Workload**: The workload is unknown or not provided. |
| 001b | **Workload 1**: Extended Idle Period with a Burst of Random Writes. Workload #1 consists of five (5) minutes of idle followed by thirty-two (32) random write commands of size 1 MiB submitted to a single controller while all other controllers in the NVM subsystem are idle, and then thirty (30) seconds of idle. |
| 010b | **Workload 2**: Heavy Sequential Writes. Workload #2 consists of 80,000 sequential write commands of size 128 KiB submitted to a single controller while all other controllers in the NVM subsystem are idle. The submission queue(s) should be sufficiently large allowing the host to ensure there are multiple commands pending at all times during the workload. |
| 011b to 111b | Reserved |
