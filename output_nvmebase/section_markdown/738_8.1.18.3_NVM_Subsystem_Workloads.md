##### 8.1.18.3 NVM Subsystem Workloads

> **Section ID**: 8.1.18.3 | **Page**: 613-614

The workload values described in this section may specify a workload hint in the Power Management
Feature (refer to section 5.2.26.1.2) to inform the NVM subsystem or indicate the conditions for the active
power level.
Active power values in the power state descriptors are specified for a particular workload since they may
vary based on the workload of the NVM subsystem. The workload field indicates the conditions to observe
the energy values. If Active Power is indicated for a power state, a corresponding workload shall also be
indicated.
The workload values are described in Figure 674.
