###### 8.1.26.4.6 Media Verification State

> **Section ID**: 8.1.26.4.6 | **Page**: 669-670

In this state, the sanitize processing completed successfully, and all media allocated for user data in the
sanitization target is readable by the host for purposes of verifying sanitization.
In this state:
a) if the sanitization target is the NVM subsystem (i.e., the sanitization target associated with this state
machine is the NVM subsystem), then the Sanitize Operation State Machine shall transition to the
Post-Verification Deallocation state if any controller in the NVM subsystem performs an Exit Media
Verification State action with a sanitization target of the NVM subsystem;
b) if the sanitization target is a namespace (i.e., the sanitization target associated with this state
machine is a namespace), then the Sanitize Operation State Machine shall transition to the Post-
Verification Deallocation state if any controller in the NVM subsystem performs an Exit Media
Verification State action with that namespace specified as the sanitization target;
c) if the sanitization target is the NVM subsystem, then all controllers in the NVM subsystem shall
abort a:
•
Sanitize command specifying the SANACT field not set to 101b (i e Exit Media Verification
•
Sanitize command specifying the SANACT field not set to 101b (i.e., Exit Media Verification
State); and
•
Sanitize Namespace command specifying the SANACT field not set to 101b (i.e., Exit
Media Verification State);
with a status code of Invalid Field in Command;
d) if the sanitization target is a namespace, then all controllers in the NVM subsystem shall abort a:
•
Sanitize command with the SANACT field not set to 101b (i.e., Exit Media Verification
State); and
•
Sanitize Namespace command for the sanitization target associated with this state
machine and with the SANACT field not set to 101b (i.e., Exit Media Verification State);
with a status code of Invalid Field in Command; and
e) all controllers and Management Endpoints in the NVM subsystem shall process commands as
described in section 8.1.26.5, with exceptions as described in the applicable NVM Express I/O
Command Set specification (e.g., the Read command in the NVM Command Set is processed as
described in the Media Verification section of the NVM Express NVM Command Set Specification).
The controller shall:
a) in the Sanitize Status log page for the sanitization target:
o
clear the Sanitize Progress (SPROG) field to 0h;
o
set the Media Verification Canceled (MVCNCLD) bit to ‘1’, if any controller in the NVM
subsystem processes a Controller Level Reset caused by:
•
an NVM Subsystem Reset; or
•
a transport-specific reset type (refer to the applicable NVM Express Transport specification
applicable NVM Express Transport specification), if any;
and
o
set the Media Verification Canceled (MVCNCLD) bit to ‘1’, in the Sanitize Status log page for
the sanitization target, if a change in the composition of the NVM subsystem prevents media
verification;
and
complete the Sanitize command or the Sanitize Namespace command with a status code of
Successful Completion, if any controller in the NVM subsystem performs an Exit Media Verification
State action for the sanitization target associated with this state machine
