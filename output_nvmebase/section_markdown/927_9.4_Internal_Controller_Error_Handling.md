### 9.4 Internal Controller Error Handling

> **Section ID**: 9.4 | **Page**: 766-766

If a controller level failure (e.g., a DRAM failure) occurs during the processing of a command, then the
controller should abort the command with a status code of Internal Error. Any data transfer associated with
the command may be incomplete or incorrect, and therefore any transferred data should not be used for
any purpose other than error reporting or diagnosis. The host may choose to re-submit the command or
indicate an error to the higher-level software.
