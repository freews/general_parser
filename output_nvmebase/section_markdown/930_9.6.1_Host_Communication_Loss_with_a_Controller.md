#### 9.6.1 Host Communication Loss with a Controller

> **Section ID**: 9.6.1 | **Page**: 767-768

A host determines that communication has been lost with a controller if:
•
the host detects a Keep Alive Timeout (refer to section 3.9);
•
for message-based transports, the host or the controller terminates the NVMe Transport connection
on which the command was sent (refer to section 3.3.2.4);
•
the host detects a transport connection loss using methods outside the scope of this specification
(e.g., the transport notifies the host of a loss of communication either with the controller to which
the command was submitted or with the queue on which the command was sent); or
•
the host reads the Lost Host Communication log page (refer to section 5.2.12.3.2) via another
controller in the same NVM subsystem and finds an entry containing the controller ID of that first
controller and the value of the Controller Instance Uniquifier (CIU) field is the same as the value of
the CIU field in the Identify Controller data structure for that controller.
Any action that terminates the NVMe Transport connection (e.g., a host reboot) causes the host to lose
communication with a controller.
A controller may detect a loss of communication at a different time (e.g., later) than the host detects that
loss of communication. As explained in section 9.6.2.1, additional time may be required for the controller to
stop processing commands after the controller detects a loss of communication.
