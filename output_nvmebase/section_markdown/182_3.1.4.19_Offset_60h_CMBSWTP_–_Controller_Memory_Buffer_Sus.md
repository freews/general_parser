##### 3.1.4.19 Offset 60h: CMBSWTP – Controller Memory Buffer Sustained Write Throughput

> **Section ID**: 3.1.4.19 | **Page**: 94-94

This optional property identifies to the host the maximum CMB sustained write throughput. A value of 0h in
this property indicates to the host that no information regarding the CMB sustained write throughput is
available.

| Bits | Type | Reset | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 31:8 | RO | Impl Spec | CMB Sustained Write Throughput (CMBSWTV): Indicates the sustained write throughput of the CMB at the maximum payload size specified by the applicable NVMe Transport binding specification (e.g., the PCIe TLP payload size, as specified in the Max_Payload_Size field of the PCIe Express Device Control (PXDC) register). The sustained write throughput of the CMB is equal to the value in this field multiplied by the units specified by the CMB Sustained Write Throughput Units field. |
| 7:4 | RO | 0h | Reserved |
| 3:0 | RO | Impl Spec | CMB Sustained Write Throughput Units (CMBSWTU): Indicates the granularity of the CMB Sustained Write Throughput field.<br>![](https://i.imgur.com/1d1d1d1.png) |
