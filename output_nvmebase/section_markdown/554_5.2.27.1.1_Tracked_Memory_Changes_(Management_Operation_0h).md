###### 5.2.27.1.1 Tracked Memory Changes (Management Operation 0h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.27.1.1 | **Page**: 474-475

The Tracked Memory Changes management operation of the Track Receive command is used to report
host memory changes by the controller specified by the Controller Identifier (CNTLID) field (refer to Figure
488) processing any and all commands (e.g., Admin commands, I/O command) as a result of tracking host
memory modifications being started by a Tracked Memory Changes management operation of the Track
Send command (refer to section 5.2.28.1.2).
The data returned is a Tracked Memory Change data structure defined by Figure 489. The identifier for the
controller that is tracked is specified in the Controller Identifier field in the Command Dword 11 field as
defined in Figure 488.
If the Track Receive command for this management operation completes successfully, then the controller
shall remove the tracked memory changes that were reported in the returned data. The reported memory
ranges identify the host memory that has changed due to the specified controller processing commands
since:
•
Track Memory Changes was enabled (refer to 5.2.28.1.2) and no tracked memory changes have
been reported by the controller; or
•
the controller last reported tracking change while the memory tracking remained enabled.
If tracked memory changes occur for the same memory address at a high frequency, the controller reporting
of the Tracking Memory Changed Descriptors for that address may be delayed by a vendor specific amount
of time so that Tracking Memory Changed Descriptors for other addresses are able to be reported during
that vendor specific amount of time.
If the Suspended bit is set to ‘1’ and the More To Report (MTR) bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the returned Track
Memory Changed data structure, then all host memory changes have been reported to the host. If the
controller specified by the CNTLID field remains suspended, then the controller has no more tracked host
memory changes to report to the host until the controller specified by the CNTLID field is resumed.
If the Suspended bit is cleared to ‘0’ and the More To Report (MTR) bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the returned Track
Memory Changed data structure, then no additional tracked host memory changes are available to report
to the host in a subsequent commands at the time of processing this command.
Figure 492 defines a Tracked Memory Changed Descriptor.
