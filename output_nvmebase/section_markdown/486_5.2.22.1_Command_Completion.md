##### 5.2.22.1 Command Completion

> **Section ID**: 5.2.22.1 | **Page**: 417-418

When the command is complete, the controller shall post a completion queue entry to the Admin Completion
Queue indicating the status for the command. All NVM subsystem sanitize operations are performed in the
background (i.e., completion of the Sanitize command that started that NVM subsystem sanitize operation
does not indicate completion of the NVM subsystem sanitize operation). If an NVM subsystem sanitize
operation starts (refer to section 8.1.26.4), then the Sanitize Status log page shall be updated before posting
the completion queue entry for the command that started that NVM subsystem sanitize operation.
Sanitize command specific status values (i.e., SCT field set to 1h) are shown in Figure 390.
