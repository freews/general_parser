> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.14.2.4 | **Page**: 270-270

A Power-on or Reset event shall be recorded in the Persistent Event Log when an NVM Subsystem Reset
(e.g., due to a power-on) or a Controller Level Reset is completed. The Power-on or Reset Event reports
information about resets due to power-on or other events that cause resets (refer to section 3.7) followed
by descriptors reporting information about the controller at the time the reset occurred, including timestamp
values for all controllers for use in synchronization of timestamp values across controllers.
The controller shall set the Persistent Event Log Event Header:
•
Event Type field to 04h; and
•
Event Type Revision field to 01h.
The Power-on or Reset Event data is specified in Figure 237.
