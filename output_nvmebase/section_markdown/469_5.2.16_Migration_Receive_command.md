#### 5.2.16 Migration Receive command

> **Section ID**: 5.2.16 | **Page**: 400-401

The Migration Receive command is used to obtain information from the controller processing the command
that the host may use to manage a migratable controller (refer to section 8.1.13).
The Migration Receive command uses the Data Pointer field, Command Dword 10 field, Command Dword
12 field, Command Dword 13 field, Command Dword 14 field, and Command Dword 15 field. The use of
the Command Dword 11 field is specific to the management operation specified by the Select field. All other
command specific fields are reserved.
The Select field defined in Figure 356 specifies the management operation to be performed. Refer to section
5.2.16.1for a description of each management operation.
If the controller supports selection of a UUID by the Migration Receive command (refer to Figure 214 and
section 8.1.30), then Command Dword 14 is used to specify a UUID Index value (refer to Figure 359).
