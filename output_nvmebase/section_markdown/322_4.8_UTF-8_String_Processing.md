### 4.8 UTF-8 String Processing

> **Section ID**: 4.8 | **Page**: 193-194

Hosts, controllers and NVM subsystems process (e.g., store, compare) UTF-8 strings used by NVMe as
binary strings without any text processing or text comparison logic that is specific to the Unicode character
set or locale (e.g., check for byte values not used by UTF-8, Unicode normalization, etc.). Any such text
processing:
a) may occur as part of entry of UTF-8 strings into hosts and NVM subsystems as shown at points 1
and 3 in Figure 141; and
b) should not occur as part of receiving UTF-8 strings via NVMe, as shown at points 2 and 4 in Figure
141.
Upon entry into the host (e.g., via a configuration interface at point 1 in Figure 141, described as “input” in
RFC 9562), a host may process a UTF-8 string (e.g., perform Unicode normalization). Upon entry into the
NVM subsystem (e.g., via a configuration interface at point 3 in Figure 141, described as “input” in RFC
9562), a controller may process a UTF-8 string (e.g., perform Unicode normalization). Upon receipt by the
host (e.g., at point 2 in Figure 141) of a UTF-8 string from the controller, text processing (e.g., Unicode
normalization) should not occur. Upon receipt by the controller (e.g., at point 4 in Figure 141) of a UTF-8
string from the host, text processing (e.g., Unicode normalization) should not occur.
