###### 3.3.2.1.3.1 Data and SGL Locations within a Command Capsule

> **Section ID**: 3.3.2.1.3.1 | **Page**: 116-117

The submission queue entry within the command capsule includes one SGL entry. If there are additional
SGL entries to be transferred in the command capsule, then those entries shall be contiguous and located
immediately after the submission queue entry.
An NVMe Transport binding specification defines the support for data as part of the command capsule. The
controller indicates the starting location of data within a command capsule via the In Capsule Data Offset
(ICDOFF) field in the Identify Controller data structure.
There are restrictions for SGLs that the host should follow:
•
if the ICDOFF field is a non-zero value, then all SGL descriptors following the submission queue
entry shall not have a total size greater than (ICDOFF * 16);
•
if the SGL descriptors following the submission queue entry have a total size greater than (ICDOFF
* 16), then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Number of SGL
Descriptors;
•
the host shall not place more SGL Data Block or Keyed SGL Data Block descriptors within a
capsule than the maximum indicated in the Identify Controller data structure; and
•
if the host places more SGL Data Block of Keyed SGL Data Block descriptors in a capsule than the
maximum indicated in the Maximum SGL Data Block Descriptors field in the Identify Controller data
structure, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Number of SGL
Descriptors.
The host shall start data (if present) in command capsules at byte offset (ICDOFF * 16) from the end of the
submission queue entry.
