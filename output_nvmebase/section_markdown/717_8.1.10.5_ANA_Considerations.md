##### 8.1.10.5 ANA Considerations

> **Section ID**: 8.1.10.5 | **Page**: 592-592

If more than one participating NVM subsystem contains controllers that provide a host with access to a
dispersed namespace, then Asymmetric Namespace Access (ANA) and Asymmetric Namespace Access
Reporting (refer to section 8.1.1) should be supported in all participating NVM subsystems. If ANA is used
with dispersed namespaces, then globally unique namespace identifiers (refer to section 8.1.10.2) are used
to determine when multiple paths are available to the same dispersed namespace. Hosts specify to
controllers that their host (e.g., multipath I/O software) uses globally unique namespace identifiers to
determine when multiple paths are available to the dispersed namespace by setting the HDISNS field to 1h
in the Host Behavior Support feature, as described in section 8.1.10.3.
ANA Group usage with dispersed namespaces is described in section 8.1.1.2.
