##### 3.5.4.1 Handling Errors During Initialization

> **Section ID**: 3.5.4.1 | **Page**: 135-135

If the CAP.CRMS field is non-zero and the controller has been enabled by transitioning CC.EN from ‘0’ to
‘1’ and the controller encounters a failure that prevents:
a) at least one:
•
command that does not access attached namespaces; or
•
Admin command that does not require access to media (refer to Figure 84),
from being able to be processed without error by the amount of time indicated by the:
•
Controller Ready Independent of Media Timeout (CRTO.CRIMT) field since the controller
was enabled if the controller is in Controller Ready Independent of Media mode (i.e., the
CC.CRIME bit is set to ‘1’); or
•
Controller Ready With Media Timeout (CRTO.CRWMT) field since the controller was
enabled if the controller is in Controller Ready With Media mode (i.e., the CC.CRIME bit is
cleared to ‘0’);
b) at least one namespace attached to the controller from becoming ready by the amount of time
indicated by the Controller Ready With Media Timeout (CRTO.CRWMT) field since the controller
was enabled; or
c) media required by at least one Admin command from becoming ready by the amount of time
indicated by the Controller Ready With Media Timeout (CRTO.CRWMT) field since the controller
was enabled,
then:
a) if the controller has not become ready, then the controller shall become ready (i.e., set CSTS.RDY
to ‘1’) no later than CRTO.CRWMT amount of time after the controller was enabled; and
b) if the Persistent Event log page is supported, then the controller shall record an NVM Subsystem
Hardware Error Event with the NVM Subsystem Hardware Error Event code set to a value of
Controller Ready Timeout Exceeded in the Persistent Event log page (refer to Figure 240).
