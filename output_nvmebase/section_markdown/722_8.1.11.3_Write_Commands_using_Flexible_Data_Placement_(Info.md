##### 8.1.11.3 Write Commands using Flexible Data Placement (Informative)

> **Section ID**: 8.1.11.3 | **Page**: 598-598

Hosts writing user data to a namespace created in an Endurance Group that has Flexible Data Placement
enabled have two mechanisms for specifying the placement of the user data with the Endurance Group to
the controller.
1.
Each namespace has a default Placement Handle. If any write command:
a. has the DTYPE field being ignored by the controller (refer to section 8.1.9.4); or
b. has the DTYPE field not being ignored by the controller and specifies a DTYPE field value
cleared to 00h,
then the Placement Handle value of 0h for the specified namespace is combined with a Reclaim
Group selected by the controller to create the Placement Identifier (refer to Figure 289 and Figure
290) utilized for that write command.
)
2.
If any write command has the DTYPE field not being ignored by the controller and specifies a
DTYPE field set to Data Placement (i.e., 02h) and specifies a namespace in which the Data
Placement Directive is enabled, then the Placement Identifier specified by the DSPEC field
specifies the Reclaim Group Identifier and Placement Handle used for the write command.
To reduce write amplification, hosts track the user data written to an entire Reclaim Unit and deallocate that
user data by issuing one or more Dataset Management commands specifying the AD bit set to ‘1’ and one
or more Range fields specifying the LBA ranges that were written to that Reclaim Unit.
