###### 8.1.9.3.2.2 Release Resources (Directive Operation 02h)

> **Section ID**: 8.1.9.3.2.2 | **Page**: 586-586

The Release Resources operation is used to release all streams resources allocated for the exclusive use
of the namespace attached to all controllers:
•
associated with the same non-zero Host Identifier of the controller that processed the operation if
the SSID bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the NSSC field is cleared to ‘0’; and
•
associated with any non-zero Host Identifier if the SSID bit is set to ‘1’.
On successful completion of this command, the exclusive allocated stream resources are released and the
Namespace Streams Allocated (refer to Figure 655) field is cleared to 0h for the specified namespace. If
this command is issued when no streams resources are allocated for the exclusive use of the namespace,
then the Directive Send command shall take no action and shall not fail as a result of no allocated stream
resources.
No data transfer occurs.
