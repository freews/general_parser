> **Section ID**: 5.2.21.1 | **Page**: 414-415

When the command is completed, the controller posts a completion queue entry to the Admin Completion
Queue indicating the status for the command.
Namespace Management command specific status values (i.e., SCT field set to 1h) are shown in Figure
386.
Dword 0 of the completion queue entry contains the Namespace Identifier created. The definition of Dword

| Value | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0Ah | Invalid Format: The User Data Format specified is not supported. This may be due to various conditions, including:<br>1) specifying an invalid User Data Format number;<br>2) enabling protection information when there are not sufficient resources (e.g., metadata per LBA); or<br>3) the specified format is not available in the current configuration. |
| 15h | Namespace Insufficient Capacity: Creating the namespace requires more unallocated capacity than is currently available. The Command Specific Information field in the Error Information Log Entry data structure (refer to Figure 209) specifies the total amount of unallocated NVM capacity required to create the namespace in bytes. |
| 16h | Namespace Identifier Unavailable: The number of namespaces supported has been exceeded. |
| 18h | Thin Provisioning Not Supported: Thin provisioning is not supported by the controller. |
| Value | Definition |
| 24h | ANA Group Identifier Invalid: The specified ANA Group Identifier (ANAGRPID) is not supported in the submitted command. This may be due to various conditions, including:<br>a) specifying an ANAGRPID that does not exist;<br>b) the controller does not allow an ANAGRPID to be specified (i.e., the ANA Group ID Support (ANAGIDS) bit in the ANACAP field is cleared to '0'); or<br>c) the specified value is not supported by the controller processing the command (e.g., the specified value exceeds ANAGRPMAX (refer to Figure 328)).<br>If the host specified a non-zero ANAGRPID, retrying the command with the ANAGRPID field cleared to 0h may succeed. |
| 29h | I/O Command Set Not Supported: The I/O Command Set specified for a create operation is not supported by the controller. |
