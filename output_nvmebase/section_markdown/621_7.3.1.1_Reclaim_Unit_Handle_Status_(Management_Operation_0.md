##### 7.3.1.1 Reclaim Unit Handle Status (Management Operation 01h)

> **Section ID**: 7.3.1.1 | **Page**: 528-529

The Reclaim Unit Handle Status management operation is used to provide information about Reclaim Unit
Handles (refer to section 1.5.89) that are accessible by the specified namespace. The returned data
contains one or more Reclaim Unit Handle Status Descriptor data structures (refer to the applicable NVM
Express I/O Command Set specification). The information contained in each Reclaim Unit Handle Status
Descriptor:
•
is the information at the time the controller processes that Reclaim Unit Handle Status Descriptor;
and
•
may or may not contain the information reflecting any outstanding command that affects the
reported Reclaim Unit Handle Status Descriptor.
If Flexible Data Placement is disabled in the Endurance Group containing the specified namespace, then
the command shall be aborted with a status code of FDP Disabled.
If the NSID field is set to 0h or FFFFFFFFh, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code
of Invalid Namespace or Format.
If the Number of Dwords (NUMD) field corresponds to a length that is greater than the size of the Reclaim
Unit Handle Status data structure (refer to Figure 597), then the entire contents of the data structure are
transferred and zeroes are transferred beyond the end of that data structure.
The Reclaim Unit Handle Status Descriptors are defined in the NVM Express I/O Command Set
specifications, if supported.
