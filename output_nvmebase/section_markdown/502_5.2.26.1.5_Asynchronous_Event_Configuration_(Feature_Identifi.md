###### 5.2.26.1.5 Asynchronous Event Configuration (Feature Identifier 0Bh)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.5 | **Page**: 429-431

This Feature controls the events that trigger an asynchronous event notification to the host. This Feature
may be used to disable reporting events by the controller in the case of a persistent condition (refer to
section 5.2.2). If the condition for an event is true when the corresponding notice is enabled, then an event
is sent to the host. The attributes are specified in Command Dword 11.
If a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure 409 are returned
in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.

| 26:22 | Reserved |
| 21 | Lost Host Communication Notices: This bit specifies whether an asynchronous event notification is reported for a Lost Host Communication asynchronous event (refer to Figure 154). If this bit is set to '1' and this condition occurs, then the Lost Host Communication asynchronous event is reported. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller shall not report the Lost Host Communication asynchronous event. |
| 20 | Cross-Controller Reset Completed Notices: This bit specifies whether an asynchronous event notification is reported for a Cross-Controller Reset Completed asynchronous event (refer to Figure 154). If this bit is set to '1' and this condition occurs, then the Cross-Controller Reset Completed asynchronous event is reported. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller shall not report the Cross-Controller Reset Completed asynchronous event. |
| 19 | Allocated Namespace Attribute Notices (ANSAN): This bit determines whether an asynchronous event notification is sent to the host when an Allocated Namespace Attribute Changed asynchronous event is sent to the host when this condition occurs. If this bit is set to '1', then the Allocated Namespace Attribute Changed asynchronous event is sent to the host when this condition occurs. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller shall not send the Allocated Namespace Attribute Changed asynchronous event to the host. |
| Bits | Description |
| 18 | Reachability Group (RGRP0): This bit determines whether an asynchronous event notification is sent to the host when a Reachability Group change occurs (i.e., the contents of the Reachability Groups log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.25) changed. If this bit is set to '1', then the Reachability Group Change Notices event is sent to the host when this condition occurs. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller shall not send the Reachability Group Change Notices event to the host. |
| 17 | Reachability Association (RASSN): This bit determines whether an asynchronous event notification is sent to the host when a Reachability Association change occurs (i.e., the contents of the Reachability Associations log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.26) changed. If this bit is set to '1', then the Reachability Association Change Notices event is sent to the host when this condition occurs. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller shall not send the Reachability Association Change Notices event to the host. |
| 16 | Temperature Threshold Hysteresis Recovery (TTHRY): This bit determines whether an asynchronous event notification is sent to the host at the end of a temperature threshold hysteresis event (refer to section 5.2.26.1.3.1). If this bit is set to '1', then the Temperature Threshold Hysteresis Recovery event is sent to the host if an outstanding Asynchronous Event Request command exists at the time this condition occurs. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller shall not send the Temperature Threshold Hysteresis Recovery event to the host. |
| 15 | Normal NVM Subsystem Shutdown (NNSSHDN): This bit determines whether an asynchronous event notification is sent to the host when the NVM subsystem has started performing a normal shutdown due to an NVM Subsystem Shutdown (refer to Figure 156). If this bit is set to '1', then the Normal NVM Subsystem Shutdown event is sent to the host if an outstanding Asynchronous Event Request command exists at the time this condition occurs. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller shall not send the Normal NVM Subsystem Shutdown event to the host. |
| 14 | Endurance Group Event Aggregate Log Change Notices (EGEALCN): This bit determines whether an asynchronous event notification is sent to the host when an event entry for an Endurance Group (refer to section 3.2.3) has been added to the Endurance Group Event Aggregate log (refer to section 5.2.12.1.15). If this bit is set to '1', then the Endurance Group Event Aggregate Log Change event is sent to the host when this condition occurs. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller shall not send the Endurance Group Event Aggregate Log Change event to the host. <br> If Endurance Groups are not supported and this bit is set to '1', then the Set Features command shall be aborted with a status of Invalid Field in Command. |

If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller shall not send the Telemetry Log Changed event to the host. |
| 09 | Firmware Activation Notices (FAN): This bit determines whether an asynchronous event notification is sent to the host for a Firmware Activation Starting event (refer to Figure 154). If this bit is set to '1', then the Firmware Activation Starting event is sent to the host when this condition occurs. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller shall not send the Firmware Activation Starting event to the host. |
| 08 | Attached Namespace Attribute Notices (NAN): This bit determines whether an asynchronous event notification is sent to the host for an Attached Namespace Attribute Changed asynchronous event (refer to Figure 154). If this bit is set to '1', then the Attached Namespace Attribute Changed asynchronous event is sent to the host when this condition occurs.
