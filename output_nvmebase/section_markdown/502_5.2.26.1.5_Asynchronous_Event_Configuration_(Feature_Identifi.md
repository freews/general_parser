###### 5.2.26.1.5 Asynchronous Event Configuration (Feature Identifier 0Bh)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.5 | **Page**: 429-431

This Feature controls the events that trigger an asynchronous event notification to the host. This Feature
may be used to disable reporting events by the controller in the case of a persistent condition (refer to
section 5.2.2). If the condition for an event is true when the corresponding notice is enabled, then an event
is sent to the host. The attributes are specified in Command Dword 11.
If a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure 409 are returned
in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.
