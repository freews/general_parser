###### 5.2.26.1.24.1 Authentication Methods

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.24.1 | **Page**: 449-449

This section defines optional authentication methods that allow a host to unfreeze a previously frozen
personality. Support for these authentication methods is indicated in the Authenticated Unfreeze Support
(AUS) field in the Personality Properties data structure (refer to Figure 285). Section 8.1.6.2 describes the
mechanisms to unfreeze a frozen personality.
The Security Send and Security Receive commands are used by the host to submit Personality Unfreeze
Request operations (refer to section 8.1.6.2). If the Security Send and Security Receive commands are not
supported, a frozen personality is permanently frozen.
If a personality supports Physical Credential Authentication (refer to the PCAS bit in Figure 285), then the
credential is a vendor-defined Physical Presence Indicator (PPI) as described in section 5.2.26.1.24.1.1.
If a personality supports Programmable Key Authentication (refer to the PKAS bit in Figure 285), then the
authentication key is derived from a host-programmable key as described in section 5.2.26.1.24.1.2.
