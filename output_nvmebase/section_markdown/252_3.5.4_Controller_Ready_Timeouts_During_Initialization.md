#### 3.5.4 Controller Ready Timeouts During Initialization

> **Section ID**: 3.5.4 | **Page**: 134-135

The CAP.CRMS field was not defined prior to NVM Express Base Specification, Revision 2.0. Controllers
compliant with revisions earlier than NVM Express Base Specification, Revision 2.0 may clear the
CAP.CRMS field to 00b. This section is applicable to controllers that clear the CAP.CRMS field to 00b and
controllers that set CAP.CRMS to a non-zero value.
There are three controller ready timeout fields
The details regarding these timeouts during controller initialization are as follows:
a) The CAP.TO field shall be set as described in Figure 36;
b) If the CAP.CRMS field is cleared to 00b’, then the worst-case time the host should wait after the
controller is enabled (i.e., CC.EN transitions from ‘0’ to ‘1’) for the controller to become ready
(CSTS.RDY transitions from ‘0’ to ‘1’) is indicated by CAP.TO;
c) If the controller is in Controller Ready With Media mode (i.e., the CC.CRIME bit is cleared to ‘0’),
then:
i.
the Controller Ready Independent of Media Timeout (CRTO.CRIMT) field is not applicable;
and
ii.
the Controller Ready With Media Timeout (CRTO.CRWMT) indicates the worst-case time
the host should wait after the controller is enabled for:
1. the controller to become ready and be able to process all commands without error
as described in section 3.5.4.1; and
2. all attached namespaces and media required to process Admin commands to
become ready;
and
d) If the controller is in Controller Ready Independent of Media mode (i.e., the CC.CRIME bit is set to
‘1’), then
i.
the Controller Ready With Media Timeout (CRTO.CRWMT) field indicates the worst-case
time that a host should wait for all attached namespaces and media required to process
Admin commands to become ready after the controller is enabled; and
ii.
the Controller Ready Independent of Media Timeout (CRTO.CRIMT) field indicates the
worst-case time the host should wait after the controller is enabled for the controller to
become ready and be able to process:
1. all commands that do not access attached namespaces; and
2. Admin commands that do not require
Changes to the value of the CC.CRIME bit shall have no effect on the values of the CRTO.CRWMT and
CRTO.CRIMT fields. Changes to the value of the CC.CRIME bit may have an effect on the value of the
CAP.TO field (refer to Figure 36).
