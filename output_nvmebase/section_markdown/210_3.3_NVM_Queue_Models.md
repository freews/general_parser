### 3.3 NVM Queue Models

> **Section ID**: 3.3 | **Page**: 111-111

The NVM Express interface is based on a paired Submission and Completion Queue mechanism.
Commands are placed by a host into a Submission Queue. Completions are placed into the associated
Completion Queue by the controller. When using a memory-based transport queue model (refer to section
3.3.1), multiple Submission Queues may utilize the same Completion Queue. When using a message-
based transport queue model (refer to section 3.3.2) each Submission Queue maps to a single Completion
Queue.
