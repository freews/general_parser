##### 5.2.4.2 Command Completion

> **Section ID**: 5.2.4.2 | **Page**: 216-216

Upon completion of the Controller Data Queue command, the controller posts a completion queue entry to
the Admin Completion Queue indicating the status for the command. Section 5.2.4.1 describes completion
details for each management operation.
If a status code of Successful Completion is returned for the Create Controller Data Queue management
operation, then Dword 0 of the completion queue entry contains the identifier of the Controller Data Queue
created as defined in Figure 172. The indicated identifier is unique to the controller that processed the
command.
Controller Data Queue command specific status values (i.e., SCT field set to 1h) are shown in Figure 173
