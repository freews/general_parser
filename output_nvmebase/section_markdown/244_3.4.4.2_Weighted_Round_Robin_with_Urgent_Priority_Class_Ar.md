##### 3.4.4.2 Weighted Round Robin with Urgent Priority Class Arbitration

> **Section ID**: 3.4.4.2 | **Page**: 126-127

In this arbitration mechanism, there are three strict priority classes and three weighted round robin priority
levels. If Submission Queue A is of higher strict priority than Submission Queue B, then all candidate
commands in Submission Queue A shall start processing before candidate commands from Submission
Queue B start processing.
The highest strict priority class is the Admin class that includes any command submitted to the Admin
Submission Queue. This class has the highest strict priority above commands submitted to any other
Submission Queue.
The next highest strict priority class is the Urgent class. Any I/O Submission Queue assigned to the Urgent
priority class is serviced next after commands submitted to the Admin Submission Queue, and before any
commands submitted to a weighted round robin priority level. A host should use care in assigning any I/O
Submission Queue to the Urgent priority class since there is the potential to starve I/O Submission Queues
in the weighted round robin priority levels as there is no fairness protocol between I/O Submission Queues
that are Urgent priority class and I/O Submission Queues that are not Urgent priority class.
The lowest strict priority class is the Weighted Round Robin class. This class consists of the three weighted
round robin priority levels (High, Medium, and Low) that share the remaining bandwidth using weighted
round robin arbitration. A host controls the weights for the High, Medium, and Low service classes via the
Set Features command. Round robin is used to arbitrate within multiple Submission Queues assigned to
the same weighted round robin level. The number of candidate commands that may start processing from
each Submission Queue per round is either the Arbitration Burst setting or the remaining weighted round
robin credits, whichever is smaller.
