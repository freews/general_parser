###### 5.2.12.1.17 Supported Capacity Configuration List (Log Page Identifier 11h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.17 | **Page**: 287-290

This log page is used to provide a list of Supported Capacity Configuration Descriptors (refer to Figure 261).
Each entry in the list defines a different configuration of Endurance Groups supported by the domain
specified in the Log Specific Identifier field in Command Dword 11 of the Get Log Page command as defined
in Figure 258.
If the NVM subsystem supports multiple domains, then the controller reports the Supported Capacity
Configuration List log page for the domain specified in the Log Specific Identifier field (refer to Figure 202),
if accessible. If the information is not accessible, then the log page is not available (refer to section 8.1.1.3).
If the Log Specific Identifier field is cleared to 0h, then the specified domain is the domain containing the
controller that is processing the command.
If the NVM subsystem supports multiple domains, then Capacity Configuration Identifier values are unique
within the specified domain. If the NVM subsystem does not support multiple domains, then Capacity
Configuration Identifier values are unique within the NVM subsystem.
In the Supported Capacity Configuration List (refer to Figure 261), Capacity Configuration Descriptors shall
be listed in ascending order by Capacity Configuration Identifier, and each Capacity Configuration Identifier
shall appear only once.
The Capacity Configuration Descriptor (refer to Figure 262) indicates the details of a particular configuration
of Endurance Groups and contains one Endurance Group Configuration Descriptor for each Endurance
Group accessible by the controller processing the command.
In the Capacity Configuration Descriptor (refer to Figure 262), Endurance Group Configuration Descriptors
shall be listed in ascending order by Endurance Group Identifier, and each Endurance Group Identifier shall
appear only once.
The Endurance Group Configuration Descriptor is defined in Figure 263.
In the Endurance Group Configuration Descriptor (refer to Figure 263), NVM Set Identifiers shall be listed
in ascending order by value, and each NVM Set Identifier shall appear only once.
In the Endurance Group Configuration Descriptor, Channel Configuration Descriptors shall be listed in
ascending order by Channel Identifier value, and each Channel Identifier shall appear only once.
The Channel Configuration Descriptor (refer to Figure 264) lists the Media Units attached to a Channel.
Media Unit Configuration Descriptors (refer to Figure 265) shall be listed in ascending order by Media Unit
Identifier, and each Media Unit Identifier shall appear only once.
The Media Unit Configuration Descriptor is defined in Figure 265.

This value is reported in billions (i.e., a value of 1h corresponds to 1,000,000,000 bytes written) and is rounded up (e.g., a value of 1h indicates the number of bytes written is from 1 to 1,000,000,000, 2h indicates the number of bytes written is from 1,000,000,001 to 2,000,000,000). A value of FFFFFFFF_FFFFFFFF_FFFFFFFF_FFFFFFFFh means that value and all higher values. A value of 0h indicates that the Endurance Estimate is not reported. The relationship between this value and the value in the Endurance Estimate field in the Endurance Group Information log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.10) is outside the scope of this specification. | |
