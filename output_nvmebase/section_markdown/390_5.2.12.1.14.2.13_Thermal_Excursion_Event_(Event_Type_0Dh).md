###### 5.2.12.1.14.2.13 Thermal Excursion Event (Event Type 0Dh)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.14.2.13 | **Page**: 280-282

A Thermal Excursion event shall be recorded in the Persistent Event Log if the Composite Temperature
has transitioned from a temperature that is less than:
•
the WCTEMP, if any, (refer to Figure 328) to a temperature that is greater than or equal to the
WCTEMP, if any; or
•
the CCTEMP, if any, (refer to Figure 328), to a temperature that is greater than or equal to the
CCTEMP, if any,
unless recording of the event causes a vendor specific frequency of threshold reports for this threshold to
be exceeded.
A Thermal Excursion event may be recorded in the Persistent Event Log if the Composite Temperature has
transitioned from a temperature:
•
that is less than TMT1 (refer to section 5.2.26.1.9), if any, to a temperature that is greater than or
equal to TMT1, if any (i.e., light throttling has started);
•
that is less than TMT2 (refer to section 5.2.26.1.9), if any, to a temperature that is greater than or
equal to TMT2, if any (i.e., heavy throttling has started);
•
that is less than a vendor specific temperature where thermal throttling occurs due to self-throttling
to a temperature that is greater than that vendor specific temperature (i.e., self-throttling has
started);
•
outside of a temperature threshold to a value that is within all temperature thresholds (i.e., the
temperature returns to normal);
•
at which thermal throttling is occurring to a temperature at which thermal throttling is stopped; or
•
that is greater than an under temperature threshold (refer to section 5.2.26.1.3) to a temperature
that is less than or equal to an under temperature threshold,
unless recording of the event causes a vendor specific frequency of threshold reports for this threshold to
be exceeded.
The Thermal Excursion event shall set the Persistent Event Log Event Header;
•
Event Type field to 0Dh; and
•
Event Type Revision field to 01h.
