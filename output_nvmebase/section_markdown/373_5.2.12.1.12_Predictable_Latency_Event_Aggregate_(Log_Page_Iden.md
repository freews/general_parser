###### 5.2.12.1.12 Predictable Latency Event Aggregate (Log Page Identifier 0Bh)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.12 | **Page**: 258-258

This log page indicates if a Predictable Latency Event (refer to section 8.1.19.1) has occurred for a particular
NVM Set. If a Predictable Latency Event has occurred, the details of the particular event are included in the
Predictable Latency Per NVM Set log page for that NVM Set. An asynchronous event is generated when
an entry for an NVM Set is newly added to this log page.
This log page shall not contain an entry (i.e., an NVM Set Identifier) that is cleared to 0h.
If there is an enabled Predictable Latency Event pending for an NVM Set, then the Predictable Latency
Event Aggregate log page includes an entry for that NVM Set. The log page is an ordered list by NVM Set
Identifier. For example, if Predictable Latency Events are pending for NVM Set 27, 13, and 17, then the log
page shall have entries in numerical order of 13, 17, and 27. A particular NVM Set is removed from this log
page after the Get Log Page command with the Retain Asynchronous Event bit cleared to ‘0’ for the
Predictable Latency Per NVM Set log page for that NVM Set is completed successfully.
The log page size is limited by the NVM Set Identifier Maximum value reported in the Identify Controller
data structure (refer to Figure 328). The log page is defined in Figure 225. If the number of dwords
requested to be returned by the Get Log Page command (refer to section 5.2.12) includes data beyond the
end of the Predictable Latency Event Aggregate log page (refer to Figure 225), then zeros shall be returned
for data transferred beyond the end of that log page.

| 07:00 | Number of Entries (NUMENT): This field indicates the number of entries in the list. The maximum number of entries in the list corresponds to the NVM Set Identifier Maximum field reported in the Identify Controller data structure. A value of 0h indicates there are no entries in the list. | |

| 09:08 | Entry 1: Indicates the NVM Set that has a Predictable Latency Event pending that has the numerically smallest NVM Set Identifier, if any. | |
| 11:10 | Entry 2: Indicates the NVM Set that has a Predictable Latency Event pending that has the second numerically smallest NVM Set Identifier, if any. | |
