###### 8.1.9.3.1.2 Get Status (Directive Operation 02h)

> **Section ID**: 8.1.9.3.1.2 | **Page**: 584-585

The Get Status operation returns information about the status of currently open streams for the specified
namespace and the host issuing the Get Status operation. The DSPEC field in command Dword 11 is not
used for this operation.
If the SSID bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the NSSC field, then the information returned describes only those
resources for the specified namespace that are associated with hosts that are registered with the same
non-zero Host Identifier value as the host issuing the Get Status operation. If the SSID bit is set to ‘1’, then
the information returned describes the resources for the specified namespace that are associated with
hosts that are registered with any non-zero Host Identifier.
If an NSID value of FFFFFFFFh is specified, then the controller shall return information about the status of
currently open streams in the NVM subsystem that use resources which are not allocated for the exclusive
use of a particular namespace. If a stream identifier value being returned is in use by different namespaces,
then that stream identifier shall be returned only once.
Stream Identifier 1 (i.e., returned at offset 03:02) contains the value of the open stream of lowest numerical
value. Each subsequent field contains the value of the next numerically greater stream identifier of an open
stream.
The data structure returned is defined in Figure 656. All fields are specific to the specified namespace if the
NSID value was not set to FFFFFFFFh.
