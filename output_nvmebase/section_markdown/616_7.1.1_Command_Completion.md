#### 7.1.1 Command Completion

> **Section ID**: 7.1.1 | **Page**: 526-527

Upon completion of the Cancel command, the controller posts a completion queue entry to the I/O
Completion Queue indicating the status for the Cancel command.
If the Cancel Action (refer to Figure 591) specified a Single Command Cancel Action and the Commands
Aborted field is cleared to 0h, then the host should examine the status in the completion queue entry of the
command to abort to determine whether the command was aborted or not (i.e., whether a deferred abort
was performed or not).
If the Cancel Action specified a Multiple Command Cancel Action, then the host should examine the status
in the completion queue entry of each command to abort to determine whether the command was aborted
or not.
Cancel command specific status code values are defined in Figure 592.
Dword 0 of the completion queue entry contains information about the number of commands that were
aborted by this command. Dword 0 of the completion queue entry is defined in Figure 593.
