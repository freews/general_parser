##### 3.1.3.4 Command Support Requirements

> **Section ID**: 3.1.3.4 | **Page**: 68-71

Figure 28, Figure 29, and Figure 30 define commands that are mandatory, optional, and prohibited for an
I/O controller, Administrative controller, and Discovery controller. I/O Command Set specific command
support requirements are described within NVM Express I/O Command Set specifications. Since an
Administrative controller does not support I/O queues, I/O Command Set specific commands that are not
Admin commands are not supported by an Administrative controller.
A host may utilize the Commands Supported and Effects log page to determine optional commands that
are supported by a controller.
