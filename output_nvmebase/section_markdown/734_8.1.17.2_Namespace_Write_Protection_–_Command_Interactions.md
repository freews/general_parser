##### 8.1.17.2 Namespace Write Protection – Command Interactions

> **Section ID**: 8.1.17.2 | **Page**: 610-610

Unless otherwise noted, the commands listed in Figure 671 are processed normally when specifying an
NSID for a namespace that is write protected.
Commands not listed in Figure 671, and which meet the following conditions, shall be aborted with a status
code of Namespace Is Write Protected (refer to Figure 102):
a) Commands that specify an NSID for a namespace that is write protected;
b) Commands that specify an NSID for a namespace that is not write protected and the execution of
which would modify another namespace that is write protected (e.g., a Format NVM command);
and
c) Commands that do not specify an NSID, and the execution of which would modify a namespace
that is write protected (e.g., Sanitize command).

| Notes: | |
| 1. The controller shall fail commands if the specified action attempts to modify the non-volatile storage medium of the specified namespace. | |
| 2. A Flush command shall complete successfully with no effect. All volatile write cache data and metadata associated with the specified namespace is written to non-volatile storage medium as part of transitioning to the write protected state (refer to section 5.2.26.1.35). | |
| 3. A Directive Receive command which attempts to allocate streams resources shall be aborted with a status code of Namespace is Write Protected. | |
