###### 8.3.2.3.4.5 {(NQN, IP, Protocol, IP Protocol Port, PortID), Role} Zone Member Type (Type 4h)

> **Section ID**: 8.3.2.3.4.5 | **Page**: 714-715

This Zone member type identifies a specific fabric interface (i.e., through the IP address), the specific IP
protocol (e.g., TCP), IP protocol port (e.g., TCP port 4420), and PortID used by the NVMe-oF entity
identified by the Zone member’s NQN over that fabric interface. The format of this Zone member type is
shown in Figure 746.

| Bytes | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 00 | **Zone Member Type (ZMTYPE)**: This field specifies the Zone member type and shall be set to 4h. |
| 02:01 | **Zone Member Length (ZMLEN)**: This field specifies the length in bytes of this Zone member type and shall be set to 100h. |
| 03 | **Zone Member Role (ZMROLE)**: This field specifies what type of entity the Zone member is. This field shall be set to one of the following values: <br> • 1h: host; or <br> • 2h: NVM subsystem. |
| 04 | **Zone Member Address Family (ZMADRFAM)**: This field specifies the IP address family. This field shall be set to one of the following values: <br> • 1h: IPv4 address family; or <br> • 2h: IPv6 address family. |
| 05 | **Zone Member IP Protocol (ZMIPPROTO)**: This field specifies the IP protocol. This field shall be set to one of the following values: <br> • 6h: TCP; or <br> • 11h: UDP. |
| 07:06 | **Zone Member Transport Service Identifier (ZMTRSVCID)**: This field specifies the TCP or UDP port. |

| Bytes | Description |
| 23:08 | **Zone Member Transport Address (ZMTRADDR)**: This field specifies the IP address. An IPv6 address is encoded in binary as follows: |
| | <table><tbody><tr><td>Bytes</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>15:00</td><td>IPv6 Address (IPV6ADDR): This field contains an IPv6 address.</td></tr></tbody></table> |
| | An IPv4 address is encoded in binary as follows: |
| | <table><tbody><tr><td>Bytes</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>03:00</td><td>IPv4 Address (IPV4ADDR): This field contains an IPv4 address.</td></tr><tr><td>15:04</td><td>Reserved</td></tr></tbody></table> |
| 25:24 | **Zone Member PortID (ZMPORTID)**: This field specifies the NVM subsystem PortID. |
| 31:26 | Reserved |
| 255:32 | **Zone Member NQN (ZMNQN)**: This field specifies the NQN (represented as a null-terminated string, NULL padded as necessary to the 224-byte maximum length) of the referenced NVM-of entity. |
