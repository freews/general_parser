###### 8.3.2.3.4.5 {(NQN, IP, Protocol, IP Protocol Port, PortID), Role} Zone Member Type (Type 4h)

> **Section ID**: 8.3.2.3.4.5 | **Page**: 714-715

This Zone member type identifies a specific fabric interface (i.e., through the IP address), the specific IP
protocol (e.g., TCP), IP protocol port (e.g., TCP port 4420), and PortID used by the NVMe-oF entity
identified by the Zone member’s NQN over that fabric interface. The format of this Zone member type is
shown in Figure 746.
