###### 5.2.26.1.25 Power Limit (Feature Identifier 23h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.25 | **Page**: 453-454

This Feature is used by the host to configure the Power Limit capability (refer to section 8.1.18.6) that
enables a host to limit the set of available NVMe power states for a controller. The power limit, specified in
the Power Limit Value (PLV) attribute, is the maximum power that is able to be consumed by the NVM
subsystem if all controllers in the NVM subsystem are subject to the same power limit. Setting a power limit
modifies the reported set of power state descriptors that are part of the Identify Controller data structure
(refer to section 8.1.18.6).
The attributes for this Feature are specified in Command Dword 13 (refer to Figure 452). Upon successful
completion of a Set Features command for this Feature, the power limit shall function as described in
section 8.1.18.6.
This Feature shall be saveable.
If a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, then the attributes described in Figure 452 are
returned in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.
If a controller processes a Set Features command for this Feature and that command specifies a power
limit indicated by the PLV field combined with the PLS field that is less than the value in the Maximum
Power (MP) field in the Power State Descriptor (PSD) for every operational power state (i.e., every power
state for which the Non-Operational State (NOPS) bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the PSD for that power state (refer
to Figure 329)), then the controller shall abort that command with a status code of Invalid Power Limit.

| 17:16 | **Power Limit Scale (PLS):** This field indicates the scale for the PLV attribute.<br><table><tr><th>Value</th><th>Definition</th></tr><tr><td>00b</td><td>Reserved</td></tr><tr><td>01b</td><td>0.0001 W</td></tr><tr><td>10b</td><td>0.01 W</td></tr><tr><td>11b</td><td>Reserved</td></tr></table> |
| 15:00 | **Power Limit Value (PLV):** This field specifies the power limit. The power in watts is equal to the value in this field multiplied by the scale indicated in the PLS field. Clearing this field to 0h in a Set Features command removes any power limit. A 0h value of this field in the results of a Get Features command indicates that there is no current power limit. |
