###### 5.2.12.1.9 Telemetry Controller-Initiated (Log Page Identifier 08h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.9 | **Page**: 252-254

This log page consists of a header (i.e., bytes 511:0 of the log page) describing the log and zero or more
Telemetry Data Blocks (refer to section 8.1.29). The header shall always be available even if there is no
Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data available. All Telemetry Data Blocks are 512 bytes in size. This log is a
controller-initiated capture of internal controller-scoped or NVM subsystem-scoped state. The scope of the
saved state is determined by the value in the Telemetry Controller-Initiated Scope field. The Telemetry
Controller-Initiated Data for Data Area 1 through Data Area 3 shall persist across all resets. The Telemetry
Controller-Initiated Data for Data Area 4 may persist across Controller Level Resets. If the host specifies a
Log Page Offset Lower value that is not a multiple of 512 bytes in the Get Log Page command for this log,
then the controller shall return an error of Invalid Field in Command.
The Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data consists of:
a) three areas, if the Data Area 4 Support (DA4S) bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the Log Page Attributes field:
Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 1, Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 2, and
Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 3; or
b) four areas, if the DA4S bit is set to ‘1’ in the Log Page Attributes field: Telemetry Controller-Initiated
Data Area 1, Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 2, Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 3
and Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 4.
All areas start at Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area Block 1. The last block of each area is indicated
in the Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area y Last Block, respectively. The telemetry data captured and
its size is implementation dependent.
The size of the log page is variable and:
•
If the DA4S bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the Log Page Attributes field, the size may be calculated using
the Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 3 Last Block field.
•
If the DA4S bit is set to ‘1’ in the Log Page Attributes field and the Extended Telemetry Data Area
4 Supported (ETDAS) field is set to 1h in the Host Behavior Support feature (refer to section
5.2.26.1.14), then the size of the log page may be calculated using the Telemetry Controller-
Initiated Data Area 4 Last Block field.
•
If the DA4S bit is set to ‘1’ in the Log Page Attributes field and the Extended Telemetry Data Area
4 Supported (ETDAS) field is cleared to 0h in the Host Behavior Support feature (refer to section
5.2.26.1.14), then the size of the log page may be calculated using the Telemetry Controller-
Initiated Data Area 3 Last Block field.
The controller shall return data for all blocks requested:
•
If the DA4S bit is cleared to ‘0’ in the Log Page Attributes field, then the data beyond the last block
in Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 3 Last Block is undefined.
•
If the DA4S bit is set to ‘1’ in the Log Page Attributes field, then the data beyond the last block in
Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 4 Last Block is undefined.
•
If the DA4S bit is set to ‘1’ in the Log Page Attributes field and the Extended Telemetry Data Area
4 Supported (ETDAS) field is cleared to 0h in the Host Behavior Support feature, then the data
beyond the last block in Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 3 Last Block is undefined.
If the host requests a data transfer that is not a multiple of 512 bytes, then the controller shall abort the
command with the status code of Invalid Field in Command.

| Bytes | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 00 | **Log Page Identifier (LID):** This field shall be set to 08h. |
| 04:01 | Reserved |
| 07:05 | **IEEE OUI Identifier (IEEE):** Contains the Organization Unique Identifier (OUI) for the controller vendor that is able to interpret the data. If this field is cleared to 0h, then no IEEE OUI Identifier is present. The OUI shall be a valid IEEE/RAC assigned identifier that is registered at http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/public.html. |
| 09:08 | **Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 1 Last Block (TCDA1LB):** Contains the value of the last block of Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 1. If the Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 1 does not contain data, then this field shall be cleared to 0h. <br> If this field is not 0h, then Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 1 begins at block 1h and ends at the block indicated in this field. |
| 11:10 | **Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 2 Last Block (TCDA2LB):** Contains the value of the last block of Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 2. This value shall be greater than or equal to the value in the Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 1 Last Block field. <br> If this field is not 0h, then Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 2 begins at block 1h and ends at the block indicated in this field. |
| 13:12 | **Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 3 Last Block (TCDA3LB):** Contains the value of the last block of Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 3. This value shall be greater than or equal to the value in the Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 2 Last Block field. <br> If this field is not 0h, then Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 3 begins at block 1h and ends at the block indicated in this field. |
| 15:14 | Reserved |
| 19:16 | **Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 4 Last Block (TCDA4LB):** Contains the value of the last block of Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 4. If the DA4S bit is set to '1' in the Log Page Attributes field, then this value shall be greater than or equal to the value in the Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 3 Last Block field. <br> If this field is not 0h, then Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 4 begins at block 1h and ends at the block contained in this field. |

| Bytes | Description |
| 381 | **Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Available (TCDA):** If this field is cleared to 0h, then the log page available to be reported in response to a Get Log Page command issued to the Admin Submission Queue consists of only the 512-byte header and does not contain saved internal state (i.e., Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 1, Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 2, Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 3 and Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Area 4 are not present). <br> If this field is set to 1h, then the log page contains saved internal state (i.e., one or more of the Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data areas shall contain valid internal data) to be reported in response to a Get Log Page command issued to the Admin Submission Queue. If this field is set to 1h, then this field shall not be cleared to 0h until a Get Log Page command with Retain Asynchronous Event bit cleared to '0' for the Telemetry Controller-Initiated log page completes successfully. This value is persistent across power states and reset. <br> Regardless of the value of this field, the log page may contain saved internal state available to be reported in response to a Get Log Page command issued out-of-band to a Management Endpoint (refer to the NVM Express Management Interface Specification). <br> Other values are reserved. |
| 382 | **Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Generation Number (TCDGN):** Contains a value that is incremented each time internal state for this log page is captured. If the value of this field is FFh, then the field shall be cleared to 0h when incremented (i.e., rolls over to 0h). This field is persistent across power cycles. |
| 383 | **Reason Identifier (RID):** Contains a vendor specific identifier that describes the operating conditions of the controller at the time of capture. The Controller-Initiated Reason Identifier field should provide an identification of unique operating conditions of the controller. |
| | **Data Block List** |
| 1023:512 | **Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Block 1:** Contains Telemetry Data Block 1 for the Telemetry Controller-Initiated log page captured at a vendor specific time. |
| 1535:1024 | **Telemetry Controller-Initiated Data Block 2:** Contains Telemetry Data Block 2 for the Telemetry Controller-Initiated log page captured at a vendor specific time. |
