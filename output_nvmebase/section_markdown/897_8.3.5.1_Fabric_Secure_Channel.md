##### 8.3.5.1 Fabric Secure Channel

> **Section ID**: 8.3.5.1 | **Page**: 738-739

The Transport Requirements field in the Fabrics Discovery Log Page Entry (refer to Figure 310) indicates
whether a fabric secure channel shall be used for an NVMe Transport connection to an NVM subsystem.
The secure channel mechanism is specific to the type of fabric.
If establishment of a secure channel fails or a secure channel is not established when required by the
controller, the resulting errors are fabric-specific and may not be reported to the NVMe layer on the host.
Such errors may result in the controller being inaccessible to the host via the NVMe Transport connection
on which the failure to establish a fabric secure channel occurred.
An NVM subsystem that requires use of a fabric secure channel (i.e., as indicated by the TSC field in the
associated Discovery Log Page Entry) shall not allow capsules to be transferred until a secure channel has
been established for the NVMe Transport connection.
All Discovery Log Page Entries for an NVM subsystem should report the same value of TREQ to each host.
Discovery Log Page Entries for an NVM subsystem may report different values of TREQ to different hosts.
Figure 783 shows an example of secure channel establishment using TLS, the fabric secure channel
protocol for NVMe/TCP.
