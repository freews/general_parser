#### 5.3.1 Create I/O Completion Queue command

> **Section ID**: 5.3.1 | **Page**: 481-481

The Create I/O Completion Queue command is used to create all I/O Completion Queues with the exception
of the Admin Completion Queue. The Admin Completion Queue is created by specifying its base address
in the ACQ property. If a PRP List is provided to describe the CQ, then the PRP List shall be maintained by
the host at the same location in host physical memory and the values in the PRP List shall not be modified
until the corresponding Delete I/O Completion Queue command for this CQ is completed successfully or
the controller is reset. If the PRP List values are modified, the behavior is undefined.
The Create I/O Completion Queue command uses the PRP Entry 1, Command Dword 10, and Command
Dword 11 fields. All other command specific fields are reserved.
