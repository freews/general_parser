###### 8.3.2.3.8.1 Overview

> **Section ID**: 8.3.2.3.8.1 | **Page**: 718-719

ZoneGroups are data structures maintained and managed (i.e., created, read, modified, or deleted) in the
Zoning database of the CDC. During access to a ZoneGroup (e.g., the ZoneGroup is created or modified)
through an administrative interface (e.g., an administrative interface on the CDC outside the scope of this
specification or the protocol defined in this specification), the ZoneGroup may become locked to access
from any other interface.
Management of ZoneGroups generally happens through an administrative interface on the CDC. Push
model Direct Discovery controllers (DDCs) may be able to manage their own ZoneGroups (i.e., ZoneGroups
having the DDC NQN as ZoneGroup Originator) as specified in section 8.3.2.3.8.2. Pull model DDCs may
be able to manage their own ZoneGroups (i.e., ZoneGroups having the DDC NQN as ZoneGroup
Originator) as specified in section 8.3.2.3.8.3.
By default, a ZoneGroup should be accessible only to an administrative interface outside the scope of this
specification on the CDC and to the ZoneGroup originator DDC through the protocol defined in this
specification.
If Fabric Zoning is not enabled on the CDC, then that CDC:
•
shall abort all Fabric Zoning commands (i.e., any Fabric Zoning command that is issued as part of
a Zoning operation) issued by a push model DDC with a status code of Requested Function
Disabled; and
•
shall not react to Pull Model DDC Request asynchronous event notifications issued by a pull model
DDC.
