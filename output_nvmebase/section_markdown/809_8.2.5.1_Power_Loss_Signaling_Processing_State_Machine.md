##### 8.2.5.1 Power Loss Signaling Processing State Machine

> **Section ID**: 8.2.5.1 | **Page**: 688-689

Figure 718 illustrates how transitions in the PLN variable initiate Power Loss Signaling processing by the
controller. Each circle represents a processing state.
For all states, a power cycle causes a transition to the PLS Not Ready state.
The Power Loss Signaling processing state of the controller determines the value of the PLA variable and
whether communications on the port are processed (refer to Figure 719).
Note: I/O command processing in all of the PLS states, other than the PLS Not Ready state, complies with
atomic operation requirements for power fail, if any, as specified in the applicable NVM Express I/O
Command Set specification.
The conditions which trigger state transitions are described in the following sections. If a transition between
two states can be caused by any one of multiple conditions, then those conditions are shown in a bullet list
with an “or” (e.g., the transition from the FQ Processing state to the PLS Not Ready state, refer to Figure
722). If a transition is caused by multiple conditions which all must occur, then those conditions are shown
as a single-item bullet list with an “and” (e.g., any of the transitions from the PLS Ready state, refer to Figure
721).
