##### 4.2.3.2 Command Specific Status Definition

> **Section ID**: 4.2.3.2 | **Page**: 170-174

Completion queue entries with a Status Code Type (SCT) of Command Specific Errors indicate an error
that is specific to a particular command opcode. Status codes of 00h to 7Fh are for Admin command errors
(refer to Figure 103). Status codes of 80h to BFh are specific to the selected I/O command sets (refer to
Figure 104).
Fabrics command errors use status codes of 80h to BFh (refer to Figure 105) and Admin command error
status codes (refer to Figure 103).
Some Fabrics command errors use Admin command error status codes (refer to Figure 103).

| Value | Definition | Commands Affected |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 80h | Incompatible Format: The NVM subsystem does not support the record format specified by the host. | Connect, Disconnect |
| 81h | Controller Busy: The controller is already associated with a host (Connect command). This value is also returned if there is no available controller (Connect command). The controller is not able to disconnect the I/O Queue at the current time (Disconnect command). | Connect, Disconnect |
| 82h | Connect Invalid Parameters: One or more of the command parameters (e.g., Host NQN, NVM Subsystem NQN, Host Identifier, Controller ID, Queue ID) specified are not valid. | Connect |
| 83h | Connect Restart Discovery: The NVM subsystem requested is not available. The host should restart the discovery process. | Connect |
| 84h | Connect Invalid Host: The host is not allowed to establish an association to any controller in the NVM subsystem or the host is not allowed to establish an association to the specified controller. | Connect |
| 85h | Invalid Queue Type: The command was sent on the wrong queue type (e.g., a Disconnect command was sent on the Admin queue). | Disconnect |
| 86h to 8Fh | Reserved | |
| 90h | Discover Restart: The snapshot of the records is now invalid or out of date. If the Discover log page was requested, then the host or Discovery controller should re-read the Discover log page. If the Host Discovery log page was requested, then the host or Discovery controller should re-read the Host Discovery log page. | Get Log Page |
| 91h | Authentication Required: NVMe in-band authentication is required and the queue has not yet been authenticated. | |
| 92h to AFh | Reserved | |
