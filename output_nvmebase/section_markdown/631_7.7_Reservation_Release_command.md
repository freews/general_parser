### 7.7 Reservation Release command

> **Section ID**: 7.7 | **Page**: 534-535

The Reservation Release command is used to release or clear a reservation held on a namespace.
The command uses Command Dword 10 and a Reservation Release data structure in memory. If the
command uses PRPs for the data transfer, then PRP Entry 1 and PRP Entry 2 fields are used. If the
command uses SGLs for the data transfer, then the SGL Entry 1 field is used. All other command specific
fields are reserved.

| Bits | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 127:00 | **Data Pointer (DPTR):** This field specifies the location of a data buffer where data is transferred from. Refer to Figure 92 for the definition of this field. |
| 31:16 | Reserved |
| 15:08 | **Reservation Type (RTYPE):** If the Reservation Release Action field is cleared to 000b (i.e., Release), then this field specifies the type of reservation. The reservation type in this field shall match the current reservation type. If the reservation type in this field does not match the current reservation type, then the controller should return a status code of Invalid Field in Command. This field is defined in Figure 605. |
| 07:05 | Reserved |
| 04 | **Dispersed Namespace Reservation Support (DISNSRS):** This bit specifies host support for reservations on dispersed namespaces for a host that supports dispersed namespaces (i.e., for a host that has set the Host Dispersed Namespace Support (HDISNS) field to 1h in the Host Behavior Support feature). <br> If this bit is set to '1', then the host supports reservations on dispersed namespaces (i.e., the host supports receiving a value of FFFDh in the Controller ID (CNTLID) field of a Registered Controller data structure or Registered Controller Extended data structure (refer to section 8.1.10.6)). <br> If this bit is cleared to '0', then the host does not support reservations on dispersed namespaces (i.e., the host does not support receiving a value of FFFDh in the Controller ID (CNTLID) field of a Registered Controller data structure or Registered Controller Extended data structure (refer to section 8.1.10.6)). If the HDISNS field is set to 1h in the Host Behavior Support feature and the host submits the command to a dispersed namespace with this bit cleared to '0', then the controller aborts the command with a status code of Namespace is Dispersed as described in section 8.1.10.6. |
| 03 | **Ignore Existing Key (IEKEY):** If this bit is set to a '1', then the controller shall return an error of Invalid Field in Command. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the Current Reservation Key is checked. |
| 02:00 | **Reservation Release Action (RRELA):** This field specifies the reservation action that is performed by the command. <br> <table><tr><th>Value</th><th>Definition</th><th>Reference</th></tr><tr><td>000b</td><td>Release</td><td>8.1.24.6</td></tr><tr><td>001b</td><td>Clear</td><td>8.1.24.8</td></tr><tr><td>010b to 111b</td><td>Reserved</td><td></td></tr></table> |
