###### 8.3.5.6.4 AVE Discovery

> **Section ID**: 8.3.5.6.4 | **Page**: 765-765

The AVE transport addresses may be configured on an NVMe entity or may be discovered by interacting
with a Discovery Controller (e.g., a CDC). An NVMe entity should randomly select any of the discovered
AVE transport addresses to connect to the AVE. The AVE Discovery log page is defined to facilitate this
discovery (refer to section 5.2.12.3.5).
