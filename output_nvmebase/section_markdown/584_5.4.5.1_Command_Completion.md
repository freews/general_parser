##### 5.4.5.1 Command Completion

> **Section ID**: 5.4.5.1 | **Page**: 499-500

The Fabric Zoning Lookup (FZL) command is used to lookup a key associated with a Zoning data structure
in the CDC. The FZL command uses the Data Pointer field, as shown in Figure 536.
Upon completion of the Fabric Zoning Lookup (FZL) command, the controller posts a completion queue
entry to the Admin Completion Queue indicating the status of the command. Command specific status
values for the FZL command are defined in Figure 537.
The key associated with the Zoning data structure that matches the specified FZL data (refer to section
8.3.2.3.8) is returned in the completion queue entry Dword 0, as shown in Figure 538.
