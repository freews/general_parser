The Sanitize command starts a sanitize operation that makes all user data previously written to the
sanitization target inaccessible (i.e., all user data has been purged, as defined in IEEE Std 2883). It is very

context and considerations for understanding the result of the operation and the practical limitations for
auditing the result of the sanitize operation.
