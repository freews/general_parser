#### 8.1.9 Directives

> **Section ID**: 8.1.9 | **Page**: 575-576

Directives is a mechanism to enable host and NVM subsystem or controller information exchange. The
Directive Receive command (refer to section 5.2.6) is used to transfer data related to a specific Directive
Type from the controller to the host. The Directive Send command (refer to section 5.2.7) is used to transfer
data related to a specific Directive Type from the host to the controller. Other commands may include a
Directive Specific value specific for a given Directive Type (e.g., the Write command in the NVM Command
Set).
Support for Directives is optional and is indicated by the Directives Supported (DIRS) bit in the Optional
Admin Command Support (OACS) field in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328).
If a controller supports Directives, then the controller shall:
•
Indicate support for Directives in the Optional Admin Command Support (OACS) field by setting
the DIRS bit to ‘1’ in the Identify Controller data structure;
•
Support the Directive Receive command;
•
Support the Directive Send command; and
•
Support the Identify Directive (i.e., Type 00h).
The Directive Types that may be supported by a controller are defined in Figure 645.
The Directive Specific field and Directive Operation field are dependent on the Directive Type specified in
the command (e.g., Directive Send, Directive Receive, or I/O command).
If a Directive is not supported or is supported and disabled, then all Directive Send commands and Directive
Receive commands with that Directive Type shall be aborted with a status code of Invalid Field in
Command.
Support for a specific Directive Type is indicated using the Return Parameters operation of the Identify
Directive. A specific Directive may be enabled or disabled using the Enable operation of the Identify
Directive. Before using a specific Directive, the host should determine if that Directive is supported and
should enable that Directive using the Identify Directive.
