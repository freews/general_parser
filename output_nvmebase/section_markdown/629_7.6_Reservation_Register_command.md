### 7.6 Reservation Register command

> **Section ID**: 7.6 | **Page**: 532-534

The Reservation Register command is used to register, unregister, or replace a reservation key.
The command uses Command Dword 10 and a Reservation Register data structure in memory (refer to
Figure 608). If the command uses PRPs for the data transfer, then PRP Entry 1 and PRP Entry 2 fields are
used. If the command uses SGLs for the data transfer, then the SGL Entry 1 field is used. All other command
specific fields are reserved.
