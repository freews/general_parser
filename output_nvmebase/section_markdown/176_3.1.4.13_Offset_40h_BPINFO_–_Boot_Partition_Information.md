| Bits | Type | Reset | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 31 | RO | Impl Spec | **Active Boot Partition ID (ABPID):** This bit indicates the identifier of the active Boot Partition. |
| 30:26 | RO | 0h | **Boot Read Status (BRS):** This field indicates the status of Boot Partition read operations initiated by the host writing to the BPRSEL.BPID field. Refer to section 8.1.3. <br> The boot read status values are defined as: <br> | Value | Definition | <br> |---|---| <br> | 00b | No Boot Partition read operation requested | <br> | 01b | Boot Partition read in progress | <br> | 10b | Boot Partition read completed successfully | <br> | 11b | Error completing Boot Partition read | <br> If a host writes the BPRSEL.BPID field, this field transitions to 01b. After successfully completing a Boot Partition read operation (i.e., transferring the contents to the boot memory buffer), the controller sets this field to 10b. If there is an error completing a Boot Partition read operation, this field is set to 11b, and the contents of the boot memory buffer are undefined. |
| 25:24 | RO | 00b | |
| 23:15 | RO | 0h | Reserved |
| 14:00 | RO | Impl Spec | **Boot Partition Size (BPSZ):** This field defines the size of each Boot Partition in multiples of 128 KiB. Both Boot Partitions are the same size. |
