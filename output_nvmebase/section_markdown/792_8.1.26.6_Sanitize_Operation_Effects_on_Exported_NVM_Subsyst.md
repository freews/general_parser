##### 8.1.26.6 Sanitize Operation Effects on Exported NVM Subsystems

> **Section ID**: 8.1.26.6 | **Page**: 674-674

Performing a sanitize operation on an Underlying NVM Subsystem (refer to section 8.3.4) sanitizes user
data in all Underlying Namespaces contained in that NVM subsystem, including any Underlying Namespace
that is associated with an Exported Namespace in any Exported NVM Subsystem (refer to section 5.4.8).
Performing a sanitize operation on an Exported Namespace (refer to section 8.3.4) sanitizes all user data
in the Underlying Namespace (refer to section 8.3.4).
If an Exported NVM Subsystem contains an Exported Namespace that is associated with an Underlying
Namespace in an Underlying NVM Subsystem for which one of the following conditions exists:
•
a sanitize operation is in progress; or
•
the most recent sanitize operation has failed and successful recovery from the failed sanitize
operation has not occurred,
then, while that condition exists, that Exported NVM Subsystem shall enforce the I/O command sanitize
operation restrictions described in section 8.1.26.5 on I/O commands that specify that Exported Namespace
and may enforce additional sanitize operation restrictions described in that section.
If an Exported Namespace is associated with an Underlying Namespace in an Underlying NVM Subsystem
for which one of the following conditions exists:
•
a sanitize operation is in progress; or
•
the most recent sanitize operation has failed and successful recovery from the failed sanitize
operation has not occurred,
then, while that condition exists, the Exported NVM Subsystem containing that Exported Namespace shall
enforce the I/O command sanitize operation restrictions described in section 8.1.26.5 on I/O commands
that specify that Exported Namespace and may enforce additional sanitize operation restrictions described
in that section.
