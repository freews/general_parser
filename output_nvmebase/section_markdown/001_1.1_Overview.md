The NVM Express® (NVMe®) interface allows a host to communicate with a non-volatile memory subsystem
(NVM subsystem). This interface is optimized for all storage solutions, attached using a variety of transports
including PCI Express®, Ethernet, InfiniBandTM, and Fibre Channel. The mapping of extensions defined in
this document to a specific NVMe Transport are defined in an NVMe Transport binding specification. The
NVMe Transport binding specification for Fibre Channel is defined in INCITS 556 Fibre Channel – Non-
Volatile Memory Express - 2 (FC-NVMe-2).
For an overview of changes from revision 2.2 to revision 2.3 and the description of the new features,
including mandatory requirements for a controller to comply with revision 2.3, refer to
