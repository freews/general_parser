###### 5.2.12.1.15 Endurance Group Event Aggregate (Log Page Identifier 0Fh)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.15 | **Page**: 285-285

This log page indicates if an Endurance Group Event (refer to section 3.2.3) has occurred for a particular
Endurance Group. If an Endurance Group Event has occurred, the details of the particular event are
included in the Endurance Group Information log page for that Endurance Group. An asynchronous event
is generated when an entry for an Endurance Group is newly added to this log page.
If there is an enabled Endurance Group Event pending for an Endurance Group, then the Endurance Group
Event Aggregate log page includes an entry for that Endurance Group. The log page is an ordered list by
Endurance Group Identifier. For example, if Endurance Group Events are pending for Endurance Group 2,
1, and 7, then the log page shall have entries in numerical order of 1, 2, and 7. A particular Endurance
Group entry is removed from this log page after the Get Log Page command is completed successfully with
the Retain Asynchronous Event bit cleared to ‘0’ for the Endurance Group Information log page for that
Endurance Group.
The log page size is limited by the Endurance Group Identifier Maximum value reported in the Identify
Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328). The log page is defined in Figure 257. If the number of
dwords requested to be returned by the Get Log Page command (refer to section 5.2.12) includes data
beyond the end of the Endurance Group Event Aggregate log page (refer to Figure 257), then zeros shall
be returned for data transferred beyond the end of that log page.
