##### 8.1.16.2 Namespace Deletion Asynchronous Event Reporting

> **Section ID**: 8.1.16.2 | **Page**: 607-608

If a delete operation is requested for a namespace:
•
via a command (e.g., a Namespace Management command or Capacity Management command)
received on the Admin Submission Queue (e.g., not via a Management Endpoint, refer to the NVM
Express Management Interface Specification), then:
each controller, to which the namespace is attached, that has Attached Namespace
Attribute Notices enabled (refer to Figure 409) other than the controller processing that
delete operation, shall issue an Attached Namespace Attribute Changed asynchronous
event as part of the delete operation to indicate a namespace change; and
each controller that has Allocated Namespace Attribute Notices enabled (refer to Figure
409) other than the controller processing that delete operation, shall issue an Allocated
Namespace Attribute Changed asynchronous event as part of the delete operation to
indicate a namespace change;
or
•
via any other method (e.g., a method outside the scope of this specification or via a Management
Endpoint, refer to the NVM Express Management Interface Specification), then:
each controller, to which the namespace is attached, that has Attached Namespace
Attribute Notices enabled (refer to Figure 409) shall issue an Attached Namespace
Attribute Changed asynchronous event as part of the delete operation to indicate a
namespace change; and
each controller that has Allocated Namespace Attribute Notices enabled (refer to Figure
409) shall issue an Allocated Namespace Attribute Changed asynchronous event as part
of the delete operation to indicate a namespace change.
