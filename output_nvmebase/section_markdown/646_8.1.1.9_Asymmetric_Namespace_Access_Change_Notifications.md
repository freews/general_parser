> **Section ID**: 8.1.1.9 | **Page**: 544-544

If Asymmetric Namespace Access Change Notices are enabled on a controller, then an Asymmetric
Namespace Access Change Notice shall be sent as described in section 5.2.26.1.5 by the controllers where
the change occurred:
a) if an ANA Group Identifier (refer to Figure 328) changes;
b) if an asymmetric namespace access state transition fails (e.g., a transition begins, but does not
complete and the controller returns to the state that existed before the transition began); or
c) upon entry to the following ANA states, unless the state entry is a result of a namespace
attachment:
•
ANA Optimized State;
•
ANA Non-Optimized State;
•
ANA Inaccessible State; and
•
ANA Persistent Loss State.
