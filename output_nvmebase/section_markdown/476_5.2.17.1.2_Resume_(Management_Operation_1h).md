###### 5.2.17.1.2 Resume (Management Operation 1h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.17.1.2 | **Page**: 405-405

The Resume management operation of the Migration Send command is a request for the controller
processing the command to resume the operation of a different controller that is suspended (refer to section
5.2.17.1.1).
The Resume management operation uses the Command Dword 11 field as defined in Figure 368 and does
not use the Management Operation Specific field.
The Resume management operation shall cause the controller specified by the Controller Identifier field
(refer to Figure 368) to start fetching and processing commands.
If the specified controller is not suspended (refer to section 5.2.17.1.1), then the controller shall abort the
command with a status code of Controller Not Suspended.
If the controller processing the command has received controller state for the specified controller to be
resumed and that controller state has not been verified and committed (refer to section 5.2.17.1.3), then
the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Command Sequence Error.
