| Bits | Type | Reset¹ | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 31:07 | RO | 0h | Reserved |
| 06 | RO | HwInit | **Shutdown Type (ST):** If CSTS.SHST is set to a non-zero value, then this bit indicates the type of shutdown reported by CSTS.SHST.<br>If this bit is set to '1', then CSTS.SHST is reporting the state of an NVM Subsystem Shutdown and this bit remains set to '1' until an NVM Subsystem Reset occurs.<br>If this bit is cleared to '0', then CSTS.SHST is reporting the state of a controller shutdown.<br>An NVM Subsystem Reset shall clear this bit to '0'. All other Controller Level Resets shall not change the value of this bit.<br>If CSTS.SHST is cleared to 00b, then this bit should be ignored by the host. |

| Bits | Type | Reset¹ | Description |
| 05 | RO | 0b | **Processing Paused (PP):** This bit indicates whether the controller is processing commands. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller is processing commands normally. If this bit is set to '1', then the controller has temporarily stopped processing commands in order to handle an event (e.g., firmware activation). This bit is only valid when CC.EN is set to '1' and CSTS.RDY is set to '1'. |
| 04 | RWC | HwInit | **NVM Subsystem Reset Occurred (NSSRO):** The initial value of this bit is set to '1' if the last occurrence of an NVM Subsystem Reset (refer to section 3.7.1) occurred while power was applied to the domain. The initial value of this bit is cleared to '0' following an NVM Subsystem Reset due to application of power to the domain. This bit is only valid if the controller supports the NVM Subsystem Reset feature defined in section 3.7.1 as indicated by CAP.NSSRS set to '1'.<br>The reset value of this bit is cleared to '0' if an NVM Subsystem Reset causes activation of a new firmware image in the domain. |
| 03:02 | RO | 00b | **Shutdown Status (SHST):** This field indicates the status of shutdown processing that is initiated by the host setting the CC.SHN field, the host setting the NSSD.NSSC field, or a Management Endpoint processing an NVMe-MI Shutdown command (refer to the NVM Express Management Interface Specification). Shutdown processing is able to occur on this controller as a consequence of a host setting the NSSD.NSSC field on another controller to initiate an NVM Subsystem Shutdown that affects this controller.<br>The shutdown status values are defined as:<br><table><tr><th>Value</th><th>Definition</th></tr><tr><td>00b</td><td>Normal operation (no shutdown has been requested)</td></tr><tr><td>01b</td><td>Shutdown processing in progress</td></tr><tr><td>10b</td><td>Shutdown processing complete</td></tr><tr><td>11b</td><td>Reserved</td></tr></table><br>If this field is set to 01b (i.e., shutdown processing in progress), then:<br>• an NVM Subsystem Reset aborts both a controller shutdown and an NVM Subsystem Shutdown; and<br>• any other type of Controller Level Reset (CLR):<br>o may or may not abort a controller shutdown; and<br>o shall not abort an NVM Subsystem Shutdown.<br>If this field is cleared to 00b (i.e., normal operation) when a CLR is initiated, then that CLR shall not change the value of this field.<br>If this field is set to 01b when a CLR is initiated, and shutdown processing is not aborted by that CLR, then CLR shall not change the value of this field.<br>If this field is set to 01b when a CLR is initiated and shutdown processing is aborted by that CLR, then CLR shall clear this field to 00b.<br>If this field is set to 10b (i.e., shutdown processing complete) when a CLR is initiated by NVM Subsystem Reset, then that CLR shall clear this field to 00b.<br>If this field is set to 10b when a CLR is initiated by a method other than NVM Subsystem Reset and:<br>• the CSTS.ST bit is set to '1', then that CLR shall not change the value of this field; and<br>• the CSTS.ST bit is cleared to '0', then that CLR shall clear this field to 00b. |
| | | | |
| | | | If the CSTS.ST bit is cleared to '0' and this field is set to 10b (i.e., controller shutdown processing is reported as complete), then to start executing commands on the controller:<br>• if the CC.EN bit is set to '1', then a CLR initiated by any method (e.g., a Controller Reset) followed by enabling the controller (i.e., host sets the CC.EN bit from '0' to '1') is required (refer to section 3.6.1). If a host submits commands to the controller without a prior CLR, then the behavior is undefined; and<br>• if the CC.EN bit is cleared to '0', then:<br>o a CLR followed by enabling the controller is required (refer to sections 3.6.1 and 3.6.2); or<br>o the CC.EN bit is required to be set to '1' and the CC.SHN field is required to be cleared to 00b with the same write to the CC property (refer to sections 3.6.1 and 3.6.2).<br>If the CSTS.ST bit is set to '1' and this field is set to 10b (i.e., NVM Subsystem Shutdown processing is reported as complete), then to start executing commands on the controller:<br>• if the CC.EN bit is set to '1', then a CLR initiated by any method (e.g., a Controller Reset) followed by enabling the controller is required to start executing commands (refer to section 3.6.3). If a host submits commands to the controller without a prior NVM Subsystem Reset, then the behavior is undefined. |
| 01 | RO | HwInit | **Controller Fatal Status (CFS):** This bit is set to '1' when a fatal controller error occurred that could not be communicated in the appropriate Completion Queue. This bit is cleared to '0' when a fatal controller error has not occurred. Refer to section 9.5.<br>The reset value of this bit is set to '1' when a fatal controller error is detected during controller initialization. |
| 00 | RO | 0b | **Ready (RDY):** This bit is set to '1' when the controller is ready to process submission queue entries after the CC.EN bit is set to '1'. This bit shall be cleared to '0' when the CC.EN bit is cleared to '0' once the controller is ready to be re-enabled. Commands should not be submitted to the controller until this bit is set to '1' after the CC.EN bit is set to '1'. Failure to follow this recommendation produces undefined results. Refer to the definition of the CAP.TO field, section 3.5.3, and section 3.5.4 for timing information related to this field.<br>If an NVM Subsystem Shutdown is reported as in progress or is reported as complete (i.e., the CSTS.ST bit is set to '1' and the CSTS.SHST field is set to 01b or is set to 10b), then an NVM Subsystem Reset is required before this bit is allowed to be set to '1' from '0'. Refer to section 3.6.3.<br>If a controller shutdown is reported as in progress or is reported as complete (i.e., the CSTS.ST bit is cleared to '0' and the CSTS.SHST field is set to 01b or is set to 10b), then before this bit is allowed to be set to '1' from '0', controller shutdown processing shall stop (e.g., complete or be terminated) and the CSTS.SHST field shall be cleared to 00b. |
| | | | Notes:<br>1. During a Controller Level Reset, the field and bit values may transition to values other than the reset value prior to indicating the reset value. |
