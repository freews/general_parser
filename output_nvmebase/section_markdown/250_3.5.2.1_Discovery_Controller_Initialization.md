##### 3.5.2.1 Discovery Controller Initialization

> **Section ID**: 3.5.2.1 | **Page**: 131-132

The initialization process for Discovery controllers is described in Figure 83.
After the Connect command completes with a status of Successful Completion, the host performs the
following steps:
1. NVMe authentication is performed if required (refer to section 8.3.5.2);
2. The host determines the controller’s capabilities by reading the Controller Capabilities property;
3. The host configures the controller’s settings by writing the Controller Configuration property,
including setting CC.EN to ‘1’ to enable command processing;
4. The host waits for the controller to indicate that the controller is ready to process commands. The
controller is ready to process commands when CSTS.RDY is set to ‘1’ in the Controller Status
property; and
5. The host determines the features and capabilities of the controller by issuing an Identify command,
specifying each applicable Controller data structure.
After initializing the Discovery controller, the host reads the Discovery log page. Refer to section 5.2.12.3.3.
