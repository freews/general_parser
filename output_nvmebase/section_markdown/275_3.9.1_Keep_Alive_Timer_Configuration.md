#### 3.9.1 Keep Alive Timer Configuration

> **Section ID**: 3.9.1 | **Page**: 151-151

A host configures the Keep Alive Timer feature by specifying a Keep Alive Timeout value in:
•
the KATO field of a Fabric Connect command (refer to section 6.3); or
•
the KATO field of a Set Features command specifying the Keep Alive Timer feature (refer to section
5.2.26.1.8).
If an NVMe Transport binding specification requires the use of the Keep Alive Timer feature, and a
command attempts to disable the Keep Alive Timer by clearing the Keep Alive Timeout value to 0h, then
the controller shall abort that command with a status code of Keep Alive Timeout Invalid and the Keep Alive
Timeout value at the controller shall not be changed. If a command attempts to set the Keep Alive Timeout
value to a value that exceeds the maximum allowed by the associated NVMe Transport binding
specification, then the controller shall abort that command with a status code of Keep Alive Timeout Invalid
and the Keep Alive Timeout value at the controller shall not be changed. If a command sets the Keep Alive
Timeout value to a non-zero value that is less than the minimum supported by the NVMe Transport or less
than the minimum supported by the specific implementation, then the controller shall set the Keep Alive
Timeout value to that minimum value.
As described in section 5.2.26.1.8, the controller rounds any Keep Alive Timeout value set by the host up
to the nearest granularity as reported in the Keep Alive Support (KAS) field (refer to Figure 328). To retrieve
the Keep Alive Timeout value being used by the controller, a host may issue a Get Features command for
the Keep Alive Timer feature.
