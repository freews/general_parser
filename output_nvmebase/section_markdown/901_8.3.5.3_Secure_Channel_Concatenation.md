##### 8.3.5.3 Secure Channel Concatenation

> **Section ID**: 8.3.5.3 | **Page**: 742-743

It is possible to leverage an authentication transaction to generate shared key material to use as pre-shared
key (PSK) to establish a secure channel (e.g., with IPsec or TLS). This PSK is generated by an
authentication transaction on an Admin Queue over an unsecure channel. Once the authentication
transaction is completed, that Admin Queue transport connection shall be disconnected by the host. The
generated PSK may then be used to set up secure channels for subsequent Admin Queue(s) and I/O
Queues.
The process of generating a PSK on an Admin Queue over an insecure channel, disconnecting that Admin
Queue transport connection, and setting up an Admin Queue over a secure channel established using that
generated PSK is called secure channel concatenation. Figure 788 shows an example of this process for
TLS with NVMe/TCP, where steps 1 to 7 show TLS secure channel concatenation for the Admin Queue
and steps 8 to 13 show the setup of TLS secure channels for the I/O Queues.
Secure channel concatenation is prohibited over any secure channel that has been established in
compliance with the requirements of an NVM Express Transport specification (e.g., the NVMe over TCP
Transport Specification). The controller response to a host that requests secure channel concatenation in
this situation is specified in section 8.3.5.4.1. In contrast, replacing a PSK for such a secure channel is
permitted (refer to section 8.3.5.4.1.
