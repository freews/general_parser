##### 4.2.3.4 Path Related Status Definition

> **Section ID**: 4.2.3.4 | **Page**: 174-175

Completion queue entries with a Status Code Type (SCT) of Path Related Status (refer to Figure 107)
indicate a status value associated with the command that is generic across many different types of
commands and applies to a specific connection between the host and controller processing the command
or between the controller and the namespace. The command for which this status is returned may be retried
on a different controller in the same NVM subsystem if more than one controller is available to the host.
In a multipath environment, unless otherwise specified, errors of this type should be retried using a different
path, if one is available.
