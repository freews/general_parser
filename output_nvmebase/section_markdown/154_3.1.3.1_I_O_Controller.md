##### 3.1.3.1 I/O Controller

> **Section ID**: 3.1.3.1 | **Page**: 63-64

An I/O controller is a controller that supports commands that provide access to user data stored on an NVM
subsystem’s non-volatile storage medium using an I/O command set and may support commands that
provide management capabilities.
An I/O controller may simultaneously support multiple I/O Command Sets. The I/O Command Sets that the
controller supports and which of these I/O Command Sets the controller simultaneously supports is reported
in the Identify I/O Command Set data structure (refer to section 5.2.13.2.19). The contents of the Identify
I/O Command Set data structure are not required to be the same for all controllers in an NVM subsystem.
Figure 24 shows an NVM subsystem with three I/O controllers. I/O controller one has two attached
namespaces, private namespace A and shared namespace B. I/O controller two also has two attached
namespaces, private namespace C and shared namespace B. I/O controller three has no attached
namespaces. At some later point in time shared namespace B may be attached to I/O controller three.
