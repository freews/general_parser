#### 8.1.19 Power Measurement and Reporting

> **Section ID**: 8.1.19 | **Page**: 621-622

Power measurement and reporting is an optional set of independent capabilities which allows the host to
utilize interval power measurements from one or more embedded power sensors in the NVM subsystem.
An interval power measurement is the smallest time-based power measurement reportable and used by
the NVM subsystem. Each interval power measurement of a power measurement type shall:
•
be the average, over a one second interval, of the power measurement samples that are taken with
a sampling rate of less than or equal to the value reported in the Interval Power Measurement
Sample Rate (IPMSR) field in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328);
•
be taken over non-overlapping one second intervals; and
•
be based on measured power, unless otherwise specified.
Figure 679 defines the power measurement types for power measurement and reporting capabilities and
fields. The power measurement type specifies what power source to measure. A power measurement type
of NVM subsystem total power is the aggregate power consumed by all components within the NVM
subsystem.
Interval power measurements are not required to be taken:
•
during a power cycle of the NVM subsystem;
•
if all controllers are in a non-operational power state;
•
during the processing of an NVM Subsystem Reset; and
•
while the CSTS.SHST field is set to 10b (i.e., shutdown processing complete) in all controllers in
the NVM subsystem.
A set of interval power measurements may be contiguous or non-contiguous in time. A set of interval power
measurements is contiguous if they are from a continuous period of time without any gaps. Examples of
actions that are able to cause a set of interval power measurements to be non-contiguous include:
•
removing power from the NVM subsystem (i.e., a power cycle);
•
entering a non-operational power state;
•
initiating an NVM Subsystem Reset; and
•
the CSTS.SHST field becoming set to 10b (i.e., shutdown processing complete) in all controllers in
the NVM subsystem.
Figure 680 lists the capabilities and fields for power measurement and reporting.
If an interval power measurement is reported in the Interval Power Measurement (IPM) field in the SMART /
Health Information log page, then interval power measurements shall be collected for that field.
If the cumulative operational energy consumed is reported in the Operational Lifetime Energy Consumed
(OLEC) field in the SMART / Health Information log page, then interval power measurements shall be
collected for that field.
The collection of interval power measurements for the Power Threshold feature and Power Measurement
capability are dependent on whether the respective capabilities are enabled.
If:
•
an interval power measurement is reported in the Interval Power Measurement (IPM) field in the
SMART / Health Information log page;
•
the cumulative operational energy consumed is reported in the Operational Lifetime Energy
Consumed (OLEC) field in the SMART / Health Information log page;
•
the Power Threshold feature is supported; or
•
the Power Measurement capability is supported,
then the controller shall set the Interval Power Measurement Sample Rate (IPMSR) field in the Identify
Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328) to a non-zero value.
Figure 681 defines the power scale for the:
•
Interval Power Scale (IPS) field (refer to Figure 158);
•
Average Interval Power Scale (AIPWRS) field (refer to Figure 297);
•
Maximum Interval Power Scale (MIPWRS) field (refer to Figure 297);
•
Power Scale (PWRS) field (refer to Figure 298); and
•
Power Threshold Scale (PTS) field (refer to Figure 453).
