##### 8.1.17.1 Namespace Write Protection – Theory of Operation

> **Section ID**: 8.1.17.1 | **Page**: 609-610

If Namespace Write Protection is supported by the controller, then the controller shall:
•
indicate the level of support for Namespace Write Protection capabilities in the Namespace Write
Protection Capabilities (NWPC) field in the Identify Controller data structure by:
setting the No Write Protect and Write Protect Support bit to ‘1’ in the NWPC field;
setting the Write Protect Until Power Cycle Support bit to ‘1’ in the NWPC field, if the Write
Protect Until Power Cycle state is supported; and
setting the Permanent Write Protect Support bit to ‘1’ in the NWPC field, if the Permanent
Write Protect state is supported;
and
•
support the Namespace Write Protection Config feature (refer to section 5.2.26.1.35).
If the controller supports the Write Protect Until Power Cycle state or the Permanent Write Protect state,
then the controller shall support the Write Protection Control field in the RPMB Device Configuration Block
data structure (refer to section 8.1.23).
The controller shall not set the All Media Read-Only bit to ‘1’ in the Critical Warning field (refer to Figure
210) if the read-only condition on the media is a result of a change in the namespace write protection state
as defined by the Namespace Write Protection State Machine (refer to Figure 670), or due to any
autonomous namespace write protection state transitions (e.g., power cycle). A host may check the current
namespace write protection state of a namespace using the Get Features command with the Namespace
Write Protection Config Feature Identifier.
If any controller in the NVM subsystem supports Namespace Write Protection, then the write protection
state of a namespace shall be enforced by any controller to which that namespace is attached.
