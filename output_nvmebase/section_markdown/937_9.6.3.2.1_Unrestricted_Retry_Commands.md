###### 9.6.3.2.1 Unrestricted Retry Commands

> **Section ID**: 9.6.3.2.1 | **Page**: 771-771

An outstanding command is an Unrestricted Retry command if that command:
a) is an idempotent command (refer to section 9.6.3.1); and
b) does not change more than ancillary state in the NVM subsystem (e.g., statistics such as the value
of the Data Units Read field in the SMART / Health Information log page (refer to Figure 210)).
For an Unrestricted Retry command:
•
the Controller Capability Change (CCC) bit;
•
the Namespace Inventory Change (NIC) bit;
•
the Namespace Capability Change (NCC) bit; and
•
the Logical Block Content Change (LBCC) bit,
are all cleared to ‘0’ in the Commands Supported and Effects data structure (refer to Figure 214) in the
Commands Supported and Effects log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.6). If any of these four bits is set to
‘1’, then that command is not an Unrestricted Retry command.
A host may retry any outstanding command that is an Unrestricted Retry command immediately after
communication loss without determining whether further controller processing of that outstanding command
is possible.
For recovery purposes, a host may treat any outstanding command that is an Unrestricted Retry command
as if that command were a Delayed Retry command or a State-Dependent Retry command.
