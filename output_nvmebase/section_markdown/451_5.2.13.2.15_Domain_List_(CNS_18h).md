> **Section ID**: 5.2.13.2.15 | **Page**: 390-391

Figure 339 defines a Domain List. The data structure is an ordered list by Domain Identifier, starting with
the first Domain Identifier that is greater than or equal to the Domain Identifier specified by the CNS Specific
Identifier field as defined in Figure 338 and is accessible by the controller processing the command. The
Domain List describes the attributes for each Domain in the list based on the Domain Attributes Entry in
Figure 340.
