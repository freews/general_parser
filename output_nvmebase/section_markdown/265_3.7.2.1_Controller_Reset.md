##### 3.7.2.1 Controller Reset

> **Section ID**: 3.7.2.1 | **Page**: 145-145

A Controller Reset is a host write to the CC property that clears CC.EN bit from ‘1’ to ‘0’. A Controller Reset
initiates a Controller Level Reset (CLR), unless an NVM Subsystem Shutdown is reported as in progress
or is reported as complete and the CAP.NSSES bit is cleared to ‘0’ as described in section 3.6.3.
The effect of a CLR initiated by a Controller Reset is a subset of the effect of a CLR initiated by any other
method. A CLR initiated by a Controller Reset:
•
does not reset certain properties as described in section 3.7.2;
•
does not change some virtualization values as described in section 5.2.13.3.1 and section 5.4.10;
and
•
does not change some feature values as described in section 5.2.26.1.7.
