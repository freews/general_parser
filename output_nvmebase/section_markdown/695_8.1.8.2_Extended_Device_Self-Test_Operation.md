##### 8.1.8.2 Extended Device Self-Test Operation

> **Section ID**: 8.1.8.2 | **Page**: 575-575

An extended device self-test operation should complete in the time indicated in the Extended Device Self-
test Time field in the Identify Controller data structure or less. The percentage complete of the extended
device self-test operation is indicated in the Current Percentage Complete field in the Device Self-test log
page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.7).
An extended device self-test operation shall persist across any Controller Level Reset and shall resume
after completion of the reset or any restoration of power, if any. The segment where the extended device
self-test operation resumes is vendor specific, but implementations should only have to perform tests again
within the last segment that was being tested prior to the reset.
An extended device self-test operation:
a) shall be aborted by a Format NVM command as described in Figure 644;
b) shall be aborted when a sanitize operation is started (refer to section 5.2.22);
c) shall be aborted if a Device Self-test command with the Self-Test Code field set to Fh is processed;
and
d) may be aborted if the specified namespace is removed from the namespace inventory.
