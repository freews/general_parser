| Requirement ID | Description |
|:---|:---|
| TTR-1 | The device shall respond successfully to the Identify command within 1 second of CC.EN being set to 1b. Some models may allow a longer time (see Section 12 Device Profiles). |
| TTR-2 | The device shall be able to process I/O commands with a successful completion within 20 seconds of CC.EN being set to 1b. Some models may allow a longer time (see Section 12 Device Profiles). |
| TTR-3 | The device shall successfully service Admin commands as soon as CSTS.RDY = 1. |
| TTR-4 | The device shall keep CSTS.RDY = 0 until the device is able to service Admin commands. Some models may allow a longer time (see Section 12 Device Profiles). |
| TTR-5 | The Shutdown Notification completion (CSTS.SHST) shall be received within 10 seconds of setting SHN bit. |
| TTR-6 | The device Controller shall support the CC.SHN (Normal and Abrupt Shutdown Notifications) at a minimum. |
| TTR-7 | When safe shutdown is completed successfully, the device shall not enter a rebuild/recovery mode on the next power on. |
| TTR-8 | Shutdown Notification shall trigger flushing of all content within the device's internal (SRAM/ DRAM) cache(s) (if one is present). |
| TTR-9 | Obsolete. See NVMe-CFG-3 (support reporting of CSTS.CFS). |
| TTR-10 | Obsolete. Moved to PLP-1 (full power-loss protection). |
| TTR-11 | Obsolete. Moved to PLP-2 (protection health check). |
| TTR-12 | Metadata rebuild due to any reason (e.g., unexpected power loss) shall not exceed 120 seconds and the device shall meet its latency requirements after this. |
| TTR-13 | Obsolete. Moved to PLP-3 (protection health check interval). |
| TTR-14 | Obsolete. Moved to PLP-4 (protection health check energy). |
| TTR-15 | In case of a successful Normal shutdown operation (CC.SHN = 1 set by the NVMe device driver), no data loss is tolerated even if PLP has failed. |
| TTR-16 | An Abrupt shutdown event shall not make the device non-functional under any conditions. |
| TTR-17 | Obsolete. Moved to PLP-5 (false detection of power loss protection). |
| TTR-18 | Obsolete. Moved to PLP-6 (capacitor holdup energy margin). |
| TTR-19 | When the CC.SHN register is written to notify the device to shutdown it shall not be assumed that power will be lost even after CC.EN is cleared to 0. Under these conditions the device shall continue to function properly based on the NVMe and PCIe Specifications. |
| TTR-20 | The device shall be able to successfully respond to Configuration space accesses within 1s from de-assertion of PERSST#. |
