| Requirement ID | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| ENDUD-1 | The device documentation shall include the number of physical bytes able to be written to the device assuming a write amplification of 1. The units should be gigabytes (10^9 bytes). |
| ENDUD-2 | The preconditioning steps to test device performance at end of life are:<br>• 50/50 Read/Write workload (by number of I/Os).<br>• 4kiB Read accesses aligned to 4kiB boundaries.<br>• 128kiB Write accesses aligned to 128kiB boundaries.<br>• Random pattern of Read addresses.<br>• Sequential pattern of Write addresses.<br>• 100% active range.<br>• 80% full device (80% data, 20% free space).<br>• 0% compressible data.<br>• Ambient temperature 35°C (95°F).<br>• Short-stroked device if capacity is 2TB or greater (see EOL-2 (method to "short stroke" the device)). |
| Requirement ID | Description |
| ENDUD-3 | The Percentage Used in the SMART / Heath Information (Log Identifier 02h) shall track linearly with bytes written and at 100% it shall match the EOL value specified in ENDUD-1 (number of physical bytes able to be written). |
