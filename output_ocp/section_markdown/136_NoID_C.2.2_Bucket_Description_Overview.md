#### C.2.2 Bucket Description Overview

> **Section ID**:  | **Page**: 119-119

There are two types of buckets Active Buckets and Static Buckets.  Active Buckets are buckets that are
updated in real time.  Static Buckets are buckets which are loaded with snapshots from the Active
Buckets.  This is a move from the Active Buckets to the Static Buckets, thus the old values in the Static
Buckets are discarded.  The Static Buckets allow hyperscale users to sample the Static Buckets over a
fixed time period to gather statistics.
