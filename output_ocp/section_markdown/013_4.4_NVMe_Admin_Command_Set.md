| Requirement ID | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| NVMe-AD-1 | The device shall support all mandatory NVMe admin commands. |
| NVMe-AD-2 | Identify – In addition to supporting all the mandatory CNS values and the associated mandatory fields within the CNS, the following optional fields in the CNS shall be supported: <br> • Format progress indicator (FPI). <br> • I/O Performance and Endurance Hints: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ NSFEAT bit 4 = 1b. |
| NVMe-AD-3 | Namespace Management command shall be supported. |
| NVMe-AD-4 | Namespace Attachment command shall be supported. |
| NVMe-AD-5 | Format NVM command shall be supported. Secure Erase Settings (SES) values 000b, 001b and 010b shall be supported. |
| NVMe-AD-6 | The device shall support NVME-MI Send and Receive. |
| NVMe-AD-7 | The device shall support the Sanitize command and meet NIST SP800-88r1 Purge requirements. Block Erase (010b) and Crypto Erase (100b) sanitize operations shall be supported. If Overwrite (011b) is supported it shall meet NIST SP800-88r1 Purge requirements. |
| NVMe-AD-8 | The device shall enable reads to sanitized LBAs to meet validation of sanitized areas per NIST SP800-88r1 (i.e., return data from media). Specifically, LBAs shall return all 0s or all 1s after a Block Erase (010b) and LBAs shall return the data generated from decryption using the new MEK after a Crypto Erase (100b) (garbage data). |
| NVMe-AD-9 | If a read operation occurs to a Sanitized LBA prior to that LBA being written, the read operation shall not report a media error because the LBA has not been written. |
| NVMe-AD-10 | The device shall support Identify command UUID List functionality (CNS value 17h). |
| NVMe-AD-11 | If the Namespace Identifier (NSID) is not used for a specific NVMe admin command, and the host specifies a non-zero NSID, then the controller shall abort the command with status Invalid Field in Command. |
