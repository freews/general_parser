| Requirement ID | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| NVMe-OPT-1 | Obsolete. Duplicate of **STD-LOG-7 (Telemetry Host-Initiated (Log Identifier 07h))** and **STD-LOG-8 (Telemetry Controller-Initiated (Log Identifier 08h))**. |
| NVMe-OPT-2 | Timestamp (Feature Identifier 0Eh) shall be supported to align the devices internal logs. |
| NVMe-OPT-3 | Background data collection by the device for either Host or Controller Initiated Telemetry shall not impact I/O latency or throughput. |
| NVMe-OPT-4 | The device shall only clear the Timestamp Origin field to 000b in the Timestamp (Feature Identifier 0Eh) on a main power cycle or NVM Subsystem Reset (e.g., NSSR). The device shall not clear the Timestamp Origin field on a power cycle of only AUX power. |
| NVMe-OPT-5 | The device shall never set the Synch field bit to 1b in the Timestamp (Feature Identifier 0Eh). |
