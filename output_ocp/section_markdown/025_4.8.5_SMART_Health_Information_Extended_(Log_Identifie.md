| Requirement ID | Byte Address | Field | # of Bytes | Field Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SMART-1 | 15:0 | Physical Media Units Written | 16 | Shall contain the number of bytes written to the media; this value includes both user and metadata written to the user and system areas. It shall be possible to use this attribute to calculate the Write Amplification Factor (WAF). |
| SMART-2 | 31:16 | Physical Media Units Read | 16 | Shall contain the number of bytes read from the media from both the user and system areas. |
| SMART-3 | 39:32 | Bad User NAND Blocks | 8 | The Raw count specifies the number of user NAND blocks that have been retired for any reason (e.g., program fails, erase fails or other events). The Normalized value shall be the percent of user spare blocks still available. The normalized value shall be set to 64h and the Raw shall be cleared to zero on factory exit. It should be noted there are 2 bytes for normalized and 6 bytes for raw count. See SLOG-4 (normalized counter) definition above. <br> **Byte Address** | **Field Description** |
| | | | | 39:38 Normalized value |
| | | | | 37:32 Raw count |
| SMART-4 | 47:40 | Bad System NAND Blocks | 8 | The Raw count specifies the number of system NAND blocks that have been retired for any reason (e.g., program fails, erase fails or other events). The Normalized value shall be the percent of system spare blocks still available. The normalized value shall be set to 64h and the Raw count shall be cleared to zero on factory exit. It should be noted there are 2 bytes for normalized and 6 bytes for raw count. See SLOG-4 (normalized counter) definition above. <br> **Byte Address** | **Field Description** |
| | | | | 47:46 Normalized value |
| | | | | 45:40 Raw count |
| | | | | A value of FFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFh indicates that the Bad User NAND block count field above represents all blocks on the device and Bad System NAND block count field is invalid. |
| SMART-5 | 55:48 | XOR Recovery Count | 8 | Total number of times XOR was invoked to recover data in NAND. This shall cover all reads from NAND. Data recovery may have succeeded or failed. This shall be cleared to zero on factory exit. |
| SMART-6 | 63:56 | Uncorrectable Read Error Count | 8 | Total count of NAND reads that were not correctable by read retries, all levels of ECC, or XOR. This shall be a count of the number of times data recovery fails and an uncorrectable read error is returned to the host. |
| SMART-7 | 71:64 | Soft ECC Error Count | 8 | Total count of NAND reads that were not correctable by first level ECC and requires invoking an intermediate recovery. This shall cover all NAND read accesses. Data recovery may have succeeded or failed. If the device has more than one intermediate recovery level, then this counter only increments when intermediate recovery level 1 is invoked. |
| SMART-8 | 79:72 | End to End Correction Counts | 8 | A count of the detected and corrected errors by the end-to-end error correction which includes DRAM, SRAM, or other storage element ECC/CRC protection mechanism (not NAND ECC). |
| | | | | All correctable errors shall result in a counter increase no matter what type of data the memory is protecting. All detected errors shall result in a counter increase unless the error is uncorrectable and occurred in the system region. In the latter case, the incomplete shutdown flag shall be flagged/incremented on the next power up. It should be noted there are 4 bytes for count of detected errors and 4 bytes for count of corrected errors. <br> **Byte Address** | **Field Description** |
| | | | | 79:76 Corrected Errors |
| | | | | 75:72 Detected Errors |
| SMART-9 | 80 | System Data % Used | 1 | A normalized cumulative count of the number of erase cycles per block since leaving the factory for the system (firmware and metadata) area. Starts at 0 and increments. 100 indicates that the estimated endurance has been consumed. Value may exceed 100 up to 255. This count shall increment regardless of what the backing media of the blocks are (e.g., SLC and TLC). If system data is split between media types, then this shall report the worst-case count so that the device wear out is clearly understood. This counter has a different behavior than the max erase cycles has been hit. |
| SMART-10 | 87:81 | Refresh Counts | 7 | This is a count of the number of blocks that have been re-allocated to maintain data integrity. This counter does not include creating free space due to garbage collection or block reallocation due to wear leveling. |
| SMART-11 | 95:88 | User Data Erase Counts | 8 | The maximum and minimum erase counts across the user NAND blocks in the device. The host shall not be able to reset this counter. It should be noted there are 4 bytes for the maximum and 4 bytes for the minimum. The Minimum User |
| | | | | Data Erase Count shall not include bad blocks. If a block goes bad, any subsequent attempts to recover the block shall not increment the Maximum User Data Erase Count field. |
| | | | | **Byte Address** | **Field Description** |
| | | | | 95:92 Minimum User Data Erase Count |
| | | | | 91:88 Maximum User Data Erase Count |
| SMART-12 | 97:96 | Thermal Throttling Status and Count | 2 | The current status of thermal throttling (throttled or not throttled) and a count of the number of thermal throttling events. Note that there is 1 byte for the current status and 1 byte for the count. For devices that only have 1 throttle point only the first level throttle bit shall be set. This shall be cleared to zero on factory exit. <br> **Byte Address** | **Field Description** |
| | | | | 97 Current Throttling Status <br> Current Status definition: <br> • 00h = unthrottled <br> • 01h = first level throttle <br> • 02h = 2nd level throttle <br> • 03h = 3rd level throttle <br> • 04h - FFh = Reserved |
| | | | | 96 Number of thermal throttling events |
| SMART-13 | 103:98 | DSSD Specification Version | 6 | Version of the DSSD Specification that this device conforms to. <br> **Byte Address** | **Field Description** |
| | | | | 103 Major Version Field. Shall be 02h. |
| | | | | 102:101 Minor Version Field. Shall be 0000h. |
| | | | | 100:99 Point Version Field. Shall be 0000h. |

| SMART-14 | 111:104 | PCIe Correctable Error Count | 8 | Summation counter of all PCIe correctable errors (bad TLP, bad DLLP, receive error, replay timeouts, replay rollovers). These counts shall only increment during run time. They shall not increment during training or power fail. This shall be cleared to zero on factory exit. |
| SMART-15 | 115:112 | Incomplete Shutdowns | 4 | A count of the number of shutdowns that have occurred that did not completely flush all required user data and metadata to non-volatile memory for any reason. This shall be cleared to zero on factory exit. |
| SMART-16 | 119:116 | Reserved | 4 | Shall be cleared to zero. |
| SMART-17 | 120 | % Free Blocks | 1 | A normalized count of the number of blocks that are currently free (available) out of the total pool of spare (invalid) blocks. Free blocks means both blocks that have been erased and blocks that have had invalid data. Invalid blocks are blocks that are either marked invalid by device firmware or by the host (via de-allocate or overwrite). For example, if the total number of spare blocks is 100 and garbage collection has been able to reclaim (garbage collection has 20 blocks, then this field reports 20%. |
| SMART-18 | 127:121 | Reserved | 7 | Shall be cleared to zero. |
| SMART-19 | 129:128 | Capacitor Health | 2 | This field is indicator of the capacitor health and represents the capacitor holdup energy margin during operation. If no PLP protection is present a value of FFFFh shall be reported. 100% represents the passing hold up energy threshold when a device leaves manufacturing. Thus, a device will typically report greater than 100% in this field after leaving manufacturing at beginning of life. 1% is the minimum hold up energy required to conduct a proper shutdown reliably. A value of 0% may or may not result in a device failing to shutdown properly. This value shall never go negative. Zero is the minimum. <br> **Capacitor Health Value = Amount of hold up energy currently on the drive** |

(i.e., no increase in the number of write operations performed by the device beyond the number of write operations requested by a host). This value shall be equivalent to the Endurance Estimate field in the Endurance Group Log (Log Identifier 09h). |
