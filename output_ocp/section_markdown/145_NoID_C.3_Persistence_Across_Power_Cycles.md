### C.3 Persistence Across Power Cycles

> **Section ID**:  | **Page**: 126-126

When either a safe or unsafe power transition happens the counters and associated Latency Monitoring
Information shall be saved such that they can be restored on the next power up transition and continue
from where the power cycle left off.  There are additional details about this in the C.5 Latency
Monitoring Feature - Challenging Event Handling section.
