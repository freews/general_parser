| Requirement ID | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| SV-1 | The non-operational shock requirement is 700G, half-sine, 0.5ms, total 6 shocks, along all three axes (+/-). |
| SV-2 | The vibration requirement during operation is: 1.8Grms, 5-500-5 Hz, Random Vibe, 20 min along all three axes. |
| SV-3 | The vibration requirement during non-operation is: 3.13Grms, 5-800-5 Hz, total 6 sweeps along all three axes, 20 minutes per sweep. |
| SV-4 | Validation flow for Shock and Vibration:<br>1. UUT (Unit Under Test), test fixture should be visually inspected and ensured that everything is torqued or secured as needed. Pictures of test fixture with and w/o UUT should be provided.<br>2. Baseline performance of device should be gathered and used as a reference against post S&V data to ensure no performance impact incurred.<br>3. Once S&V testing is completed, repeat visual inspection to the UUT and test fixture to ensure no physical damage or performance impact has occurred to the UUT or test fixture.<br>4. Re-run stress test on the UUT in case of non-op test and provide data indicating no performance impact incurred to the unit |
