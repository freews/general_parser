| Requirement ID | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| PWR-1 | The Power Management (Feature Identifier 02h) shall be supported and the NVMe Power State Descriptor table in Identify Controller Data Structure bytes 3071:2048 shall be filled out per the NVMe 1.4b specification. |
| PWR-2 | Obsolete. See <u>DCLP-9 (DSSD Power State Table Descriptors)</u> and <u>Section 4.8.10.2 DSSD Power State Descriptor</u>. |
| PWR-3 | The method of measurement for Maximum Average Power (MAP) is defined in <u>PCM-1 (device max average power)</u>. MAP values are reported in the Maximum Power (MP) field of NVMe Power State Descriptors. |
| PWR-4 | Power state entries above the maximum rated power envelope of the device shall not be populated in the NVMe Power State Descriptor table in Identify Controller Data Structure bytes 3071:2048. |
| PWR-5 | The Set Features for Power Management (Feature Identifier 02h) with the SV bit 31 in Command Dword 10 shall be supported so that the power level can be set and will be saved across power cycles. |
| PWR-6 | The device, regardless of form factor or capacity, shall have an idle power of 5 Watts or less with European regulation. |
| PWR-7 | The device shall not consume more power than the PCI-SIG Slot Capabilities register Slot Power Limit regardless of other settings (e.g., DSSD Power State, NVMe Power State). |
