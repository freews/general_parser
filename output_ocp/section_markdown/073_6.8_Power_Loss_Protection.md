| Requirement ID | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| PLP-1 | The device shall support full power-loss protection for all acknowledged data and metadata. |
| PLP-2 | The Power-loss protection health check shall not impact I/O latency and performance. |
| PLP-3 | Power-loss protection health check shall be performed by the device at power-on (prior to accepting any writes) and at least once every time interval as specified in **SPLPI-13 (PLP Health Check Interval)**. |
| PLP-4 | While performing the power-loss protection health check, the device shall still have enough energy to be able to handle an abrupt power loss properly. |
| PLP-5 | The firmware/hardware algorithm shall deploy safeguards to prevent a false detection of power loss protection failure. Example of a false detection would be a glitch in any of the power loss circuitry readings which would cause a transient event to trigger a false power loss protection failure when the power loss protection hardware is healthy. |
| PLP-6 | The device shall implement a power-loss protection (PLP) health check which can detect the capacitor holdup energy margin reported in the Capacitor Health field specified in **SMART-19 (Capacitor Health)** in SMART / Heath Information Extended (Log Identifier COh). The PLP health check shall not just check for open/short capacitor conditions but shall measure the true available margin energy. |
| PLP-7 | The factory default PLP Health Check Interval shall be 15 minutes (see **GPLP-2 (PLP Health Check Interval)**. |
| PLP-8 | The default PLP Health Check Interval of 15 minutes (see **GPLP-2 (PLP Health Check Interval)**) shall not cause the device to violate REL-1 or REL-2. |
| PLP-9 | The device shall use the following workflow for the PLP Health Check (see **INCS-1 (power-loss protection mechanism fails)** for PLP AEN details): |
