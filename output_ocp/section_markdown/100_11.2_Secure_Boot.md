### 11.2 Secure Boot

> **Section ID**: 11.2 | **Page**: 101-101

The device shall support Secure Boot.  There are two fundamental things to address for secure boot:
The vendor should follow the recommendations in the TCG Publication for Hardware Requirements for
a Device Identifier Composition Engine.  DICE coupled with RIOT Core and Source for RIOT can help
implement Cryptographic Identity with implicit attestation.
