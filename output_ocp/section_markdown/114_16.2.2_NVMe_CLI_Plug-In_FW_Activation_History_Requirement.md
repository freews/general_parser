| Requirement ID | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| UTIL-FWHS T-1 | A table with entries that indicate the history of Firmware activation on the device. |
| UTIL-FWHS T-2 | Using the plugin command in UTIL-NM-4 (vs-drive-info) will retrieve the table. |
| UTIL-FWHS T-3 | Lists the last twenty recorded Firmware Activation History Entries as defined in FWHS T-LOG-3. Oldest entries are on top. |
| UTIL-FWHS T-4 | When the device is first shipped from the factory, there are no entries recorded. |
| UTIL-FWHS T-5 | Obsolete. See FWHS T-LOG-3 (Firmware Activation History Entry shall be recorded). |
| UTIL-FWHS T-6 | Redundant activation events shall not generate a new entry to prevent the scrolling out of useful information. An entry is redundant if it meets ALL the criteria below:<br>1. POH is within 1 minute from the last RECORDED entry.<br>2. Power cycle count is the same.<br>3. Current firmware is the same.<br>4. New FW activated is the same.<br>5. Slot number is the same.<br>6. Commit Action Type is the same.<br>7. Results are the same. |
| UTIL-FWHS T-7 | Firmware Activation History's output column headers shall follow the requirements below: |
| Requirement ID | Firmware Activation History Column Header | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| UTIL-FWHS T-8 | Firmware Activation Counter | Increments every time a firmware activation is attempted no matter if the result is good or bad. Shall be cleared to zero at factory exit. |
| UTIL-FWHS T-9 | Power on Hour | Displays the POH of the SSD when the new firmware activation is completed, and the SSD is running with the new firmware. Accuracy needs to be down to the second. |
| UTIL-FWHS T-10 | Power Cycle Count | Display the power cycle count that the firmware activation occurred. |
| UTIL-FWHS T-11 | Previous Firmware | Displays the firmware that was running on the SSD before the firmware activation took place. |
| UTIL-FWHS T-12 | New Firmware Activated | Displays the activated firmware version that is running on the SSD after the firmware activation took place. |
| UTIL-FWHS T-13 | Slot Number | Displays the slot that the firmware is being activated from. |
| Requirement ID | Firmware Activation History Column Header | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| UTIL-FWHS T-14 | Commit Action Type | Displays the Commit action type associated with the firmware activation event. |
| UTIL-FWHS T-15 | Result | Records the results of the firmware activation event. A passing event shall state a "Pass" for the result. A failing event shall state a "Failed" + the error code associated with the failure. |
