Latency outliers are very undesirable in the data center.  The goal of this feature is to allow production
monitoring of SSD QOS outliers and to debug outlier issues in production.  This feature will allow
suppliers and hyperscale companies to clearly understand if the outliers are caused by the SSD or other
components in the Host system.  This feature enables SSD suppliers to effectively debug latency issues
efficiently.  This feature will enable predicting when latency outliers are growing and likely to impact
hyperscale customers.  This feature enables many use cases involving understanding and debugging
latency issues at scale in a production environment.
