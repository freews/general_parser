of the shutdown sequence for any reason that causes the device to be unable to guarantee data/metadata
integrity (e.g., firmware hang/crash, capacitor failure, PLP circuit failure, etc.).

| Requirement ID | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| INCS-1 | When the power-loss protection mechanism fails for any reason while power is applied, the device shall set Critical Warning bit 4 to 1b in the SMART / Health Information (Log Identifier 02h) and transition to the write behavior as defined in the EOL/PLP Failure Mode (Feature Identifier C2h). |
| INCS-2 | The device shall incorporate a shutdown checksum or flag as the very last piece of data written to flash to detect incomplete shutdown. |
| INCS-3 | This checksum in INCS-2 shall be used on power-up to confirm that the previous shutdown was 100% successful. |
| INCS-4 | An incomplete shutdown shall result in an increase in the Incomplete Shutdowns field (SMART-15) in the SMART / Health Information Extended (Log Identifier C0h) and the SMART / Health Information (Log Identifier 02h) Critical Warning field shall have bit 3 set to 1b. |
| INCS-5 | The device shall still support data eradication via the Sanitize command even if it is operating in Read Only Mode (ROM), and it shall support admin commands. |
| INCS-6 | When the device increments the Incomplete Shutdowns field in SMART / Health Information Extended (Log Identifier C0h), it shall use the following recovery procedure at the next power up: |
