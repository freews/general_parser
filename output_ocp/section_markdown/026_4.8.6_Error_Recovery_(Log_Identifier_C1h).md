| FWHST-LOG-1 | Lists the last twenty firmware images that were activated (not downloaded) on the device. This is a circular buffer where the 21st entry is placed in entry 0 (byte offset 8 and). |
| FWHST-LOG-2 | When the device is first shipped from the factory, there are no entries recorded. |
| FWHST-LOG-3 | A Firmware Activation History Entry shall be recorded as shown in the table below whenever a new firmware is activated by the device. Firmware downloads shall not generate an entry. |

| FWHST-LOG-4 | Redundant activation events shall not generate a new entry to prevent the scrolling out of useful information. An entry shall be considered redundant if it meets ALL the criteria below:<br>1. Timestamp is within 1 minute from the last RECORDED entry; and<br>2. Power cycle count is the same; and<br>3. Current firmware is the same; and<br>4. New firmware activated is the same; and<br>5. Slot number is the same; and<br>6. Commit Action Type is the same; and<br>7. The Result field has not changed. |
