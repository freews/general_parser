| Requirement ID | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| NUSE-1 | The NUSE shall be equal to the number of logical blocks currently allocated in the namespace. NUSE cannot be hardcoded to be equal to NCAP. Here is an example for a 200GB device: |
| | 1. After a Format NVM command User Data Erase (SES = 001b), NUSE would be zero. And the usage data would reflect that: 0.00GB. |
| | 2. After writing 1 GB worth of data, the usage data is expected to show the following: 1.00GB. |
| | 3. After filling the device, the usage data is expected to show the following: 200.00GB. |
| | 4. If the host issues a 10GB de-allocate command and the device completes de-allocation of the data, the usage data would show the following: 190.00GB. |
