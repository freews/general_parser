| Requirement ID | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| SLOG-1 | All values in the Vendor Log pages shall be persistent across power cycles unless otherwise specified. |
| SLOG-2 | All counters shall be saturating counters (i.e., if the counter reaches the maximum allowable size, it stops incrementing and does NOT roll back to 0) unless otherwise specified. |
| SLOG-3 | All values in logs shall be little endian format. |
| SLOG-4 | A normalized counter, unless otherwise specified, shall be reported as the following: 100% shall represent the number at factory exit. 1% shall represent the minimum amount to be reliable. A value of 0% means the device shall no longer be considered reliable. 100% shall be represented as 64h. |
| SLOG-5 | Devices shall support the attributes listed in Section 5.14.1.2 of the NVMe specification version 1.4b. |
| SLOG-6 | A Read of either the SMART / Health Information (Log Identifier 02h) or SMART / Health Information Extended (Log Identifier C0h) shall not require an update of the SMART values other than the temperature values in SLOG-8. It shall be a simple read of the current data and shall not block IO. |
| SLOG-7 | Unless otherwise specified, the device shall update these values in the background at least once every ten minutes. |
| SLOG-8 | The composite and raw temperature sensor values shall be updated when the log page is accessed. |
| Requirement ID | Description |
| SLOG-9 | All assert events and controller-initiated log captures will require an associated vendor-specific "Reason Identifier" that uniquely identifies the assert/controller condition. |
| SLOG-10 | The device shall not lose any data in either the SMART / Health Information (Log Identifier 02h) or SMART / Health Information Extended (Log Identifier C0h) which is more than 10 minutes old including across power cycles/resets. |
| SLOG-11 | The device shall not lose any back up energy source failure information or SMART / Health Information (Log Identifier 02h) critical warnings or SMART / Health Information Extended (Log Identifier C0h) critical warnings including across power cycles/resets. |
