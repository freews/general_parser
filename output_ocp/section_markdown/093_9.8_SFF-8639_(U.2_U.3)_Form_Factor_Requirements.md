| Requirement ID | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| FF8639-1 | The device shall adhere to the latest revisions of SFF-TA-1001 and PCI Express SFF-8639 Module Specification. |
| FF8639-2 | The device shall support Separate Refclk Independent SSC Architecture (SRIS) requirements of the PCIe Express Base Specification Revision 3.0 and its ECNs.<br>Devices shall support SRIS detection as described in SFF-8639 Module Specification Rev 4.0 or later.<br>The SRIS support shall include a clock tolerance of a 5600-ppm difference for separate reference clocks. |
| FF8639-3 | Activity LED<br>All 2.5 SFF NVMe devices shall support the activity LED function on Pin 11 of the SFF-8639 connector.<br>Pin 11 shall assert (see FF8639-4 (Active State)) while processing a command, the device shall drive the activity LED signal to an asserted state for 50ms and then to a negated state for 50ms (i.e., The LED is usually off, but flashes on and off while commands are processed).<br>The activity cycle time frame for the blinking (assertion time + de-assertion time) shall be 500 milliseconds.<br>If there is no activity the signal shall be de-asserted. |
| FF8639-4 | Active State (pin asserted and LED on) is defined as logic "0" (i.e., < 0.3 volts) on Pin 11. Inactive State is defined as logic "1" (i.e., > 3.3 volts) on Pin 11.<br>A device's internally initiated background activity or maintenance routine that is not commanded to be performed from the host shall not cause the LED to be in the Active State (logic "0" level). |
