| Requirement ID | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| THERM-1 | Support for devices in data centers located at an altitude of up to 10,000 feet above sea level is required (e.g., thermals, cosmic rays, etc.). When considering thermals, there shall be no de-rating up to 6,000 feet above sea level. Above 6,000 feet the derating shall be 0.9°C (1.6°F)/1000ft. |
| THERM-2 | A thermal study with each platform is required and shall be provided to the customer. The thermal design shall be validated up to 35°C (95°F) ambient temperature for the platform with a worst-case airflow of 1.5 meters per second at sea level. |
| THERM-3 | The device shall operate normally with relative humidity to be between 10% and 90%. |
