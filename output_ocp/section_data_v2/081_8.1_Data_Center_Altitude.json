When considering thermals, there shall be no de-rating up to 6,000 feet above sea level. Above 6,000 feet the derating shall be 0.9°C (1.6°F)/1000ft. |\n| THERM-2 | A thermal study with each platform is required and shall be provided to the customer. The thermal design shall be validated up to 35°C (95°F) ambient temperature for the platform with a worst-case airflow of 1.5 meters per second at sea level. |\n| THERM-3 | The device shall operate normally with relative humidity to be between 10% and 90%. |"
