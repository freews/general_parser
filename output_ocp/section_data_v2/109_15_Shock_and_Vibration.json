UUT (Unit Under Test), test fixture should be visually inspected and ensured that everything is torqued or secured as needed. Pictures of test fixture with and w/o UUT should be provided.<br>2. Baseline performance of device should be gathered and used as a reference against post S&V data to ensure no performance impact incurred.<br>3. Once S&V testing is completed, repeat visual inspection to the UUT and test fixture to ensure no physical damage or performance impact has occurred to the UUT or test fixture.<br>4. Re-run stress test on the UUT in case of non-op test and provide data indicating no performance impact incurred to the unit |"
