The device shall set bit 1 of the SMART / Health Information (Log Identifier 02h) Critical Warning field to 1b. |\n| TTHROTTLE-3 | Thermal throttling shall only engage under certain failure conditions such as excessive server ambient temperature or beyond the server's fan failure redundancy limit. The required behavior is illustrated below:<br><img src=\"image_url\" alt=\"Thermal Throttling Diagram\"> |\n| TTHROTTLE-4 | The firmware algorithm shall deploy safeguards to prevent a false activation of either thermal throttling or thermal shutdown. Example of a false activation would be a glitch in any of the sensor readings which would cause the composite temperature to reach the thermal throttling or thermal shutdown limit. |\n| TTHROTTLE-5 | A composite temperature of 77°C (170.6°F) shall be used for throttling. |\n| TTHROTTLE-6 | Thermal throttling shall not start based on the rate of temperature increase or slew rate. |\n| TTHROTTLE-7 | When the device is in the thermal throttling state and the temperature drops back down below 75°C (167°F), the device shall exit the thermal throttling state and an Asynchronous Event Request shall be completed with the Asynchronous Event Type field set to 001b (SMART / Health status) and the Asynchronous Event Information field set to 01h (Temperature Threshold). The device shall clear bit 1 of the SMART / Health Information (Log Identifier 02h) Critical Warning field to 0b. |\n| TTHROTTLE-8 | When the device reaches a critical temperature on any component it shall report a composite temperature of 85°C (185°F) and an Asynchronous Event Request shall be |\n| Requirement ID | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| | completed with the Asynchronous Event Type field set to 001b (SMART / Health status) and the Asynchronous Event Information field set to 01h (Temperature Threshold) before the device shuts off to protect itself. |\n| TTHROTTLE-9 | The device shall report a value of 015Eh (77°C) in the Warning Composite Temperature Threshold (WCTEMP) field of the Identify Controller Data structure. |\n| TTHROTTLE-10 | The device shall report a value of 0166h (85°C) in the Critical Composite Temperature Threshold (CCTEMP) field of the Identify Controller Data structure. |\n| TTHROTTLE-11 | If the Composite Temperature is greater than or equal to 77°C (170.6°F), the device shall update the Warning Composite Temperature Time field of the SMART / Health Information (Log Identifier 02h) once a minute until one of the following occurs:<br>- The device Composite Temperature falls below 75°C (167°F), or<br>- The device shuts down due to an over Critical Temperature condition, or<br>- The device is power cycled. |"
