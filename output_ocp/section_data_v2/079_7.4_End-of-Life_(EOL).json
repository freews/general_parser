Media reserved for background operations shall be proportionally adjusted. Short Stroke firmware capacity shall be reduced to a range of 10%-3% of full capacity. Short stroke shall cover all the channels/dies/planes while maintaining the native performance of the device. |\n| EOL-3 | Upon reaching 100% of specified device endurance, the device shall notify the host with an AEN. |\n| EOL-4 | The device shall continue to operate in a read/write mode until the conditions in EOL-5 are reached. |\n| EOL-5 | The device shall switch to Read Only Mode (ROM) when the available spares field in the SMART / Health Information (Log Identifier 02h) reaches 0%. A value of 0% represents the device state where there is an insufficient number of spare blocks to support Host writes. After the device switches to read-only mode, bit 2 and bit 3 of the Critical Warning field of Section 5.14.1.2 SMART Attributes in the NVMe specification version 1.4b shall be set to 1b.<br><br>The device shall set bit 0 of the Critical Warning field to 1b in the SMART Attributes specified in Section 5.14.1.2 of the NVMe specification version 1.4b and generate a Critical Warning async notification (AEN) when the available spare value falls below the available spare threshold. |"
