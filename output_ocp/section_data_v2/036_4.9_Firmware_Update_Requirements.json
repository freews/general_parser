The Maximum Time for Firmware Activation (MTFA) field shall not exceed Ah. |\n| FWUP-8 | When attempting to downgrade to incompatible firmware revision, the device shall return Firmware Activation Prohibited (13h) status to a Firmware Commit command. All lower security revision firmware images shall be considered incompatible. |\n| FWUP-9 | The firmware image in each valid firmware slot shall have multiple copies of that firmware image for reliability. A single corrupted firmware image shall not result in the device no longer functioning. |\n| FWUP-10 | Firmware activation shall not cause user data to be lost or destroyed. |\n| FWUP-11 | Firmware activation without reset shall preserve the current state of the device (e.g., Opal locking state, Set Features, Timestamp, Log Page contents, etc.). |"
