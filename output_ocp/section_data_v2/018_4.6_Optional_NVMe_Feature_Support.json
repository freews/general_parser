The device shall not clear the Timestamp Origin field on a power cycle of only AUX power. |\n| NVMe-OPT-5 | The device shall never set the Synch field bit to 1b in the Timestamp (Feature Identifier 0Eh). |\n| NVMe-OPT-6 | The device shall only generate a Controller initiated Telemetry AER on an error condition and shall not generate a Controller initiated Telemetry AER for periodic logging. |\n| NVMe-OPT-7 | The device shall report its Indirection Unit (IU) size in the NPWG field in the Identify Namespace Data Structure. |"
