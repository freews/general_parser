The functioning of the Amber LED shall be independent of the 12V, 3.3Vaux and the state of the PWRDIS pin. |\n| FFE1S-8 | The thermal performance of the 9.5mm, 15mm, and 25mm cases and their associated pressure drops shall be provided. |\n| FFE1S-9 | The PWRDIS pin shall be supported. |\n| FFE1S-10 | The SMBus electrical connections shall follow the \"DC Specification For 3.3V Logic Signaling\" as defined in SFF-TA-1009 revision 2.0. Including Vih1 with a max of 3.465V. |\n| FFE1S-11 | The device's SMBus protocol shall comply to version 3.1 (see http://smbus.org/specs/SMBus_3_1_20180319.pdf). |\n| FFE1S-12 | A x4 device shall only have a 1C connector. |"
