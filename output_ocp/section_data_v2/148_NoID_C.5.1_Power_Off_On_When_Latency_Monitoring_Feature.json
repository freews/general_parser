When the device powers back on the Latency Monitoring Feature shall restore the\nActive/Static Bucket/Debug Information including loading the Active Bucket Counter.  Once the\nrestoration is complete then the device shall resume the Latency Monitor functionality.  The device shall\nstart capturing latency data within 2 minutes of power on.  Thus, commands for the first 2 minutes may\nnot be monitored.  The Active Latency Window is not enforced across power cycles.  Thus, after a\npower cycle the Active Latency Window shall not start until a Bucket Counter is incremented.",
