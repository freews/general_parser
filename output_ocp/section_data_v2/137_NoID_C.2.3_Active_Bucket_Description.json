    "text": "The high-level concept is to create 4 real time buckets groups of active latency tracking command counters.\nEach bucket will count latency events which exceed a configured latency threshold.  Below is a description\nof each bucket:\nEach bucket contains the following:\n• Saturating Read Command Counter with an associated Measured Latency and Latency\nTimestamp.\n• Saturating Write Command Counter with an associated Measured Latency and Latency\nTimestamp.\n• Saturating De-allocate/TRIM Command Counter with an associated Measured Latency and\nLatency Timestamp.\nFor clarity, the opcode to Counter mapping is below:\nIn addition to the command counters there is a Measured Latency data structure and a Latency\nTimestamp data structure associated with each command counter.  The Measured Latency and Latency\nTimestamp have a direct relationship such that both are updated, or neither are updated.  The Measured\nLatency and Latency Timestamp will be described later in this document.",
