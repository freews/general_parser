Telemetry data including SMART / Health Information (Log Identifier 02h) and SMART / Health Information Extended (Log Identifier C0h) shall be persisted across power loss, all resets, Format command, Sanitize command, or device entering any protected mode (e.g., read only or panic mode). |\n| TEL-4 | The Reason Identifier field shall be the most recent failure identifier and shall not be cleared by a power cycle or reset. |\n| TEL-5 | The table below provides the specifications for the controller-initiated and the host-initiated log page “data areas”: <br> <table> <tr> <th>Data Area</th> <th>Purpose</th> <th>Data Area Size</th> <th>Latency Impact to IO</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Periodic logging for monitoring trends/problems</td> <td>Vendor-specific</td> <td><1ms typical, 10ms max</td> </tr> </table> <br> Implementation of Data areas 2 and 3 are optional and shall not be used for periodic logging. |\n| TEL-6 | Obsolete. |\n| TEL-7 | Obsolete. |"
