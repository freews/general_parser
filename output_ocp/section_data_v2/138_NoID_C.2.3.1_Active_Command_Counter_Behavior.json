These active command counters count until\nthe command counter saturates or the Active Bucket Timer expires.  Below is the behavior for each of\nthese events:\n• Active Command Counter Saturation:\nIf the Command Counter saturates, the counter shall maintain the active value and\nnot wrap.\n• Active Bucket Timer Expiration:\nIf the Active Bucket Timer Expires, then the following occurs:\no The Active Bucket Command Counter values and associated\ninformation are moved into Static Bucket Command Counters, the\nActive Bucket Command Counters are then cleared to zero and re-\nstart counting.\no The active command counters shall count regardless of how the\nActive Latency Minimum Window is configured.",
