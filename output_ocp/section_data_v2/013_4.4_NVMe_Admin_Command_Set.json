Secure Erase Settings (SES) values 000b, 001b and 010b shall be supported. |\n| NVMe-AD-6 | The device shall support NVMe-MI Send and Receive. |\n| NVMe-AD-7 | The device shall support the Sanitize command and meet NIST SP800-88r1 Purge requirements. Block Erase (010b) and Crypto Erase (100b) sanitize operations shall be supported. If Overwrite (011b) is supported it shall meet NIST SP800-88r1 Purge requirements. |\n| NVMe-AD-8 | The device shall enable reads to sanitized LBAs to meet validation of sanitized areas per NIST SP800-88r1 (i.e., return data from media). Specifically, LBAs shall return all 0s or all 1s after a Block Erase (010b) and LBAs shall return the data generated from decryption using the new MEK after a Crypto Erase (100b) (garbage data). |\n| NVMe-AD-9 | If a read operation occurs to a Sanitized LBA prior to that LBA being written, the read operation shall not report a media error because the LBA has not been written. |\n| NVMe-AD-10 | The device shall support Identify command UUID List functionality (CNS value 17h). |\n| NVMe-AD-11 | If the Namespace Identifier (NSID) is not used for a specific NVMe admin command, and the host specifies a non-zero NSID, then the controller shall abort the command with status Invalid Field in Command. |"
