NUSE cannot be hardcoded to be equal to NCAP. Here is an example for a 200GB device: |\n| | 1. After a Format NVM command User Data Erase (SES = 001b), NUSE would be zero. And the usage data would reflect that: 0.00GB. |\n| | 2. After writing 1 GB worth of data, the usage data is expected to show the following: 1.00GB. |\n| | 3. After filling the device, the usage data is expected to show the following: 200.00GB. |\n| | 4. If the host issues a 10GB de-allocate command and the device completes de-allocation of the data, the usage data would show the following: 190.00GB. |"
