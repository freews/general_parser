Two different devices shall not report a composite temperature greater than 2 degrees apart under the same environmental conditions, slot location, and workload. |\n| TRPT-3 | A single device's composite temperature shall not vary by more than +/-1°C (1.8°F) degrees once it is in a steady state under the same environmental conditions, slot location, and workload. |\n| TRPT-4 | The supplier shall provide to the customer the equation, settings, and thresholds used to calculate the composite temperature. |"
