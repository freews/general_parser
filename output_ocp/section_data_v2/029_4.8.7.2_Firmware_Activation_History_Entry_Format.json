Shall be set to 01h. |\n| FAHE-2 | 1 | Entry Length (EL) | 1 | This field indicates the length in bytes of the entry log event data. Shall be set to 40h. |\n| FAHE-3 | 3:2 | Reserved | 2 | Shall be cleared to zero. |\n| FAHE-4 | 5:4 | Firmware Activation Count | 2 | This field shall increment every time a firmware activation is attempted regardless of the result. This value shall be cleared to zero when the device is shipped from the factory. This field shall be a saturating counter. This field is not affected by a Clear Firmware History (Feature Identifier C1h) Set Feature and continues counting from the next integer on the next Firmware Activation. |\n| FAHE-5 | 13:6 | Timestamp | 8 | This field shall indicate the Timestamp of when the new firmware activation is completed, and the device is running with the new firmware. The format of this field shall be as defined in Section 5.21.1.14 Timestamp (Feature Identifier 0Eh) of the NVMe 1.4b specification. |\n| FAHE-6 | 21:14 | Reserved | 8 | Shall be cleared to zero. |\n| FAHE-7 | 29:22 | Power Cycle Count | 8 | This field shall indicate the power cycle count in which the firmware activation occurred. |\n| FAHE-8 | 37:30 | Previous Firmware | 8 | This field shall indicate the previous firmware version running on the device before this firmware activation took place. The format of this field shall be as defined in field Firmware Revision (FR) Section 5.15.2.2 Identify Controller Data Structure of the NVMe 1.4b specification. |\n| FAHE-9 | 45:38 | New Firmware Activated | 8 | This field shall indicate the firmware version that is running on the activated device after the firmware activation took place. If firmware activation failed, then this field shall display the same information as FAHE-8. The format of this field shall be as defined in field Firmware Revision (FR) Section 5.15.2.2 Identify Controller Data Structure of the NVMe 1.4b specification. |\n| FAHE-10 | 46 | Slot Number | 1 | This field shall indicate the slot that the activated firmware is in. |\n| FAHE-11 | 47 | Commit Action Type | 1 | This field shall indicate the Commit action type associated with the firmware activation event. |\n| FAHE-12 | 49:48 | Result | 2 | This field shall indicate the results of the firmware activation event. A value of 0000h shall represent the firmware commit was successful. A non-zero value shall represent the firmware commit was unsuccessful and the value represents the status code associated with the failure. |\n| FAHE-13 | 63:50 | Reserved | 14 | Shall be cleared to zero. |"
