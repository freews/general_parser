CTO-1 does not apply to the time taken by background operations initiated by the Self-Test and Sanitize commands. |\n| CTO-2 | The only exceptions to CTO-1 shall be Format and the TCG commands Revert, RevertSP and GenKey. |\n| CTO-3 | Once TTR-2 is satisfied, an individual I/O command (QD1) shall take no more than 8 seconds from submission to completion. The device shall not have more than 7 I/Os take more than 2 seconds in one hour. |\n| CTO-4 | I/O command processing time shall not be a function of device capacity. |\n| CTO-5 | Device supplier shall disclose any I/O scenario that could violate the timeout requirements in CTO-1 through CTO-4. |"
