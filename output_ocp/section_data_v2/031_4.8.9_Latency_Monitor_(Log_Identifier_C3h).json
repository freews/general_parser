When cleared to 0b all features in the Latency Monitoring Log page are disabled for this device and can be ignored. When cleared to 0b the other fields in this log page are not power loss safe and may be lost.<br>5 - Reserved. The default value shall be 07h. |\n| LMDATA-2 | 1 | Reserved | 1 | The default value shall be 07h. |\n| Requirement ID | Byte Address | Field | # of Bytes | Field Description |\n| LMDATA-3 | 32 | Active Bucket Timer | 2 | The Active Bucket Timer is in 5-minute increments. Thus, a value of 0000h is 5 minutes. The value of 0001h represents the amount of time the Active Bucket Timer has been accumulating data. The Active Bucket Timer will saturate at FFFFh. When the Active Bucket Timer reaches the data specified in Appendix C - Latency Monitoring Feature: Definition of Operation is moved to the Static Bucket, the Active Bucket Timer is cleared to 0000h and restarts counting. If the Active Bucket Timer is running and there is no power cycle the Active Bucket Timer value from before the power cycle shall be restored and the Active Bucket Timer and the Active Bucket Timer shall continue when the device is powered on. |\n| LMDATA-5 | 5/4 | Active Bucket Threshold | 2 | The Active Bucket Timer Threshold is the threshold used to compare with the Active Bucket Timer. When cleared to 0000h this threshold is not used. When the Active Bucket Timer is not loaded and the Static Bucket will not be loaded, this threshold is in 5-minute increments. |\n| LMDATA-6 | 7 | Active Threshold A | 1 | The factory default value of the Active Bucket Threshold shall be set to 0100h. |\n| LMDATA-7 | 8 | Active Threshold B | 1 | This defines Active Threshold A. This is in 5ms increments. A value of 00h represents 5ms. A value of 01h represents 1.280 seconds. The factory default is 01h. |\n| LMDATA-8 | 8 | Active Threshold C | 1 | This is in 5ms increments. The factory default is 12h. |\n| LMDATA-9 | 9 | Active Latency D | 1 | This is in 5ms increments. The factory default is 2h. |\n| LMDATA-10 | 11/10 | Active Latency | 2 | This configures how both the Active Latency Stamp, and the Active Measured Latency Fields Timer expire. |\n| | | | | Bit | Bit | Counter | Description |\n| | | | | 15-12 | N/A | N/A | Reserved.

When cleared to 0h this feature is disabled. This count is a 100 milliseconds increments, thus a value of 01h is 100 milliseconds and 02h is 200 milliseconds. Once a Latency Stamp/Measured Latency is updated if the Active Latency Minimum Window time has not expired and an event is configured to generate a latency stamp/Measured Latency occurs the Latency Stamp/Measured Latency will not be recorded. The default value of this field is 0Ah. |\n| LMDATA-12 | 47:32 | Active Bucket Counter 0 | 16 | Byte Address | Description |\n| | | | | 47:36 | Read Command Counter. |\n| | | | | 43:40 | Write Command Counter. |\n| | | | | 39:36 | De-Allocate/TRIM Command Counter. |\n| | | | | 35:32 | Reserved.
