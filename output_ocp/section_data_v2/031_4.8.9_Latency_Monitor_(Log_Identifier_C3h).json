Measured Latency Supported.<br>When set to 1b the Active Measured Latency field is supported and shall be present in the Active Latency Configuration settings. When cleared to 0b the Active Measured Latency is not supported.<br>1 Active Latency Configuration/Active Latency Mode 1 Supported.<br>When set to 1b the device shall support the Active Latency Configuration with the Active Latency Mode = 1b. When cleared to 0b the device does not support Active Latency Mode 1b.<br>0 Latency Monitoring Feature Enabled<br>This is a global feature enable.<br>When set to 1b the latency monitoring feature for this device is enabled. When cleared to 0b all features in the Latency Monitoring Log page are disabled for this device and can be ignored. When cleared to 0b the other fields in this log page are not power loss safe and may be corrupted. |\n| LMDATA-2 | 1 | Reserved | 1 | The default value shall be 07h. |\n| Requirement ID | Byte Address | Field | # of Bytes | Field Description |\n| LMDATA-3 | 32 | Active Bucket Timer | 2 | The Active Bucket Timer is in 5-millisecond increments. Thus, a value of 0000h is 5 minutes. The Active Bucket Timer is used to count the number of times the Active Buckets have been accumulating data. The Active Bucket Timer will saturate at FFFFh. This represents the amount of time the Active Bucket Timer reaches the Active Bucket Timer Threshold then the data specified in Appendix C – Latency Monitoring Register Set Theory of Operation is moved into the Static Buckets, the Active Bucket Timer is cleared to 0000h and restarts counting. If the Active Bucket Timer is running and there is a power cycle the Active Bucket Timer value from the power cycle shall be restored into the Active Bucket Timer and the Active Bucket Timer shall continue when the device is powered up.<br>The factory default value of the Active Bucket Timer Threshold shall be set to 07D0h. This is in 5ms increments. The factory default is 13.2 seconds. The factory default value shall be 07D0h. |\n| LMDATA-4 | 5:4 | Active Threshold A | 2 | When the Active Latency Stamp is in 5-millisecond increments. Thus, a value of 0000h is 5 minutes. The Active Bucket Timer will saturate, and the Active Bucket Timer will not be loaded. This threshold is in 5-millisecond increments. This is in 5ms increments. The factory default is 13.2 seconds. The factory default value shall be 07D0h. |\n| LMDATA-6 | 7 | Active Threshold B | 1 | This defines Active Bucket A. This is in 5ms increments. The factory default is 13.2 seconds. |\n| LMDATA-7 | 8 | Active Threshold C | 1 | This is in 5ms increments. The factory default is 13.2 seconds. |\n| LMDATA-8 | 9 | Active Threshold D | 1 | This is in 5ms increments. The factory default is 13.2 seconds. |\n| LMDATA-9 | 11:10 | Active Threshold E | 2 | This configures both the Active Latency Stamp, and the Active Measured Latency Fields. |\n| Requirement ID | Byte Address | Field | # of Bytes | Field Description |\n| LMDATA-5 | 6 | Active Threshold A | 1 | This defines Active Bucket A.
