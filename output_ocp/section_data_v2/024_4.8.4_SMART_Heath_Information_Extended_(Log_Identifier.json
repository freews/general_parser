A value of 0% means the device shall no longer be considered reliable. 100% shall be represented as 64h. |\n| SLOG-5 | Devices shall support the attributes listed in Section 5.14.1.2 of the NVMe specification version 1.4b. |\n| SLOG-6 | A Read of either the SMART /Health Information (Log Identifier 02h) or SMART / Health Information Extended (Log Identifier C0h) shall not require an update of the SMART values other than the temperature values in SLOG-8. It shall be a simple read of the current data and shall not block IO. |\n| SLOG-7 | Unless otherwise specified, the device shall update these values in the background at least once every ten minutes. |\n| SLOG-8 | The composite and raw temperature sensor values shall be updated when the log page is accessed. |\n| Requirement ID | Description |\n| SLOG-9 | All assert events and controller-initiated log captures will require an associated vendor-specific \"Reason Identifier\" that uniquely identifies the assert/controller condition. |\n| SLOG-10 | The device shall not lose any data in either the SMART / Health Information (Log Identifier 02h) or SMART / Health Information Extended (Log Identifier C0h) which is more than 10 minutes old including across power cycles/resets. |\n| SLOG-11 | The device shall not lose any back up energy source failure information or SMART / Health Information (Log Identifier 02h) critical warnings or SMART / Health Information Extended (Log Identifier C0h) critical warnings including across power cycles/resets. |"
