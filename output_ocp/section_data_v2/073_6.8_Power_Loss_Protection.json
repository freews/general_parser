Example of a false detection would be a glitch in any of the power loss circuitry readings which would cause a transient event to trigger a false power loss protection failure when the power loss protection hardware is healthy. |\n| PLP-6 | The device shall implement a power-loss protection (PLP) health check which can detect the capacitor holdup energy margin reported in the Capacitor Health field specified in SMART-19 (Capacitor Health) in SMART / Heath Information Extended (Log Identifier COh). The PLP health check shall not just check for open/short capacitor conditions but shall measure the true available margin energy. |\n| PLP-7 | The factory default PLP Health Check Interval shall be 15 minutes (see GPLP-2 (PLP Health Check Interval). |\n| PLP-8 | The default PLP Health Check Interval of 15 minutes (see GPLP-2 (PLP Health Check Interval)) shall not cause the device to violate REL-1 or REL-2. |\n| PLP-9 | The device shall use the following workflow for the PLP Health Check (see INCS-1 (power-loss protection mechanism fails) for PLP AEN details): |"
