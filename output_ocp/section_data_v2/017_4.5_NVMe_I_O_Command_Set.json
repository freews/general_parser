The device shall support the Attribute – Deallocate (AD) bit. |\n| NVMe-IO-3 | Since the device is power fail safe (e.g., has Power Loss Protection (PLP)) the performance shall not be degraded by any of the following:<br>• FUA – i.e., forced unit access shall not incur a performance penalty.<br>• Flush Cache – i.e., flush cache shall have no effect as the PLP makes any cache non-volatile.<br>• Volatile Write Cache (Feature Identifier 06h) Set Feature to disable write-cache. This command shall be failed as described in the NVMe Standard 1.4b as there is no volatile write cache. |\n| NVMe-IO-4 | The device shall support the Write Zeros command. The following bits of the Write Zeros command shall be supported:<br>• De-allocate (DEAC) bit.<br>• Force Unit Access (FUA) bit. |\n| NVMe-IO-5 | The Write Zeros command shall have the following behavior:<br>![](https://i.imgur.com/1d4d4d4.png) |\n| NVMe-IO-6 | If the Write Zeros DEAC bit is set to 1b and the FUA bit is cleared to 0b, the device shall un-map the specified blocks and shall return a zero value for any subsequent read to the specified blocks regardless of the behavior of the Dataset Management command. |\n| NVMe-IO-7 | With the DEAC bit set to 1b and the FUA bit cleared to 0b one or more Write Zeros command(s) shall be able to completely update the FTL map of the entire device in less than one minute. |\n| NVMe-IO-8 | The device shall support the Compare command. |\n| NVMe-IO-9 | The device shall support the Compare and Write fused command pair. |\n| NVMe-IO-10 | For some models (see Section 12 Device Profiles), the device shall support the Write Uncorrectable command. |\n| NVMe-IO-11 | The Write Uncorrectable command shall support marking LBAs uncorrectable at a single LBA granularity regardless of the number of LBAs in the FTL indirection granularity. |\n| NVMe-IO-12 | The device shall not limit the number of LBAs that the host is able to specify in a Write Uncorrectable command beyond the minimum and maximum allowed by NVMe. The host shall be able to send a single LBA. |\n| Requirement ID | Description |\n| NVMe-IO-13 | There shall be no limit on the total media capacity that can be marked uncorrectable by Write Uncorrectable commands. |\n| NVMe-IO-14 | Uncorrectable errors (e.g., read errors) that are a consequence of a prior Write Uncorrectable command shall not be counted in the Smart / Health Information (Log Identifier 02h) Media and Data Integrity Errors field. |"
