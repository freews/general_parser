### 9.3 Memory Error Handling

> **Section ID**: 9.3 | **Page**: 766-766

For PCI Express implementations, memory errors such as target abort, master abort, and parity may cause
the controller to stop processing the currently executing command. These are serious errors that cannot be
recovered from without the host intervention.
A master abort or target abort error occurs when the host has provided, to the controller, the address of
memory that does not exist. When this occurs, the controller aborts the command with a Data Transfer
Error status code.
