> **Section ID**: 8.3.2.3.4.9 | **Page**: 716-717

This Zone member type identifies the fabric interface (i.e., through the IP address) of an NVMe-oF entity,
the specific IP protocol (e.g., TCP), and IP protocol port (e.g., TCP port 4420) used by the NVMe-oF entity
over that fabric interface. The format of this Zone member type is shown in Figure 750.
