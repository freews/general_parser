#### 8.3.5 NVMe over Fabrics Secure Channel and In-band Authentication

> **Section ID**: 8.3.5 | **Page**: 738-738

NVMe over Fabrics supports both fabric secure channel (that includes authentication) and NVMe in-band
authentication. Fabric authentication is part of establishing a fabric secure channel via an NVMe Transport
specific protocol that provides authentication, encryption, and integrity checking (e.g., IPsec; refer to RFC
4301 or TLS; refer to RFC 8446). NVMe in-band authentication is performed immediately after a Connect
command (refer to section 6.3) succeeds using the Authentication Send and Authentication Receive
commands (refer to section 6.1 and section 6.2) to tunnel authentication protocol commands between the
host and the controller.
Enrollment of the host and controller in an authentication mechanism, including provisioning of
authentication credentials to the host and controller, is outside the scope of this specification.
If both fabric secure channel and NVMe in-band authentication are used, the identities for these two
instances of authentication may differ for the same NVMe Transport connection. For example, if an iWARP
NVMe Transport is used with IPsec as the fabric secure channel technology, the IPsec identities for
authentication are associated with the IP network (e.g., DNS host name or IP address), whereas NVMe in-
band authentication uses NVMe identities (i.e., Host NQNs). The NVMe Transport binding specification
may provide further guidance and requirements on the relationship between these two identities, but
determination of which NVMe Transport identities are authorized to be used with which NVMe identities is
part of the security policy for the deployed NVM subsystem.
