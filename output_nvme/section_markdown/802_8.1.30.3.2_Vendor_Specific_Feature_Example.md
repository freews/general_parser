###### 8.1.30.3.2 Vendor Specific Feature Example

> **Section ID**: 8.1.30.3.2 | **Page**: 681-682

If entity C and entity V create different definitions for a vendor specific feature having the same Feature
Identifier (e.g., F1h), then each assigns a UUID to distinguish their definitions (e.g., entity V assigns UUID
V and entity C assigns UUID C).
A controller supporting both definitions of the feature for the Get Features command:
a) Sets the UUID List bit to ‘1’ in the CTRATT field of the Identify Controller data structure (refer to
Figure 328);
b) Sets the UUID Selection Supported bit to ‘1’ in the Commands Supported and Effects data structure
(refer to Figure 214) corresponding to the Get Features command;
c) Sets the UUID Selection Supported bit to ‘1’ in the FID Supported and Effects log page (refer to
Figure 267); and
d) Reports both UUID V and UUID C in the UUID list (refer to Figure 336).
A host retrieving the attributes of the feature defined by entity C:
A host retrieving the attributes of the feature defined by entity V:
1) Determines the index of UUID V in the UUID list;
