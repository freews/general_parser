##### 8.1.7.2 Controller Data Queue Phase Tag

> **Section ID**: 8.1.7.2 | **Page**: 573-573

The Controller Data Queue Phase Tag (CDQP) bit indicates whether a CDQ entry is new. The CDQP bit
for each CDQ entry in the CDQ shall be initialized to ‘0’ by the host before creating the CDQ by submitting
a Controller Data Queue command (refer to section 5.2.4) specifying the Create Queue management
operation (refer to section 5.2.4.1.1).
When the controller posts a new CDQ entry to the CDQ, the controller shall invert the CDQP bit in that CDQ
entry (i.e., the inverting of the CDQP bit enables the host to detect the new CDQ entry).
When a CDQ entry is posted to a CDQ slot in the CDQ for the first time after the CDQ is created, the CDQP
bit for that completion queue entry is set to ‘1’.
This continues for each CDQ entry that is posted until the controller posts a CDQ entry to the highest
numbered CDQ slot and wraps to CDQ slot number 0 as described in section 8.1.7.1. When that CDQ wrap
condition occurs, the CDQP bit is then cleared to ‘0’ in each CDQ entry that is posted. This continues until
another CDQ wrap condition occurs. Each time a CDQ wrap condition occurs, the value of the CDQP bit is
inverted (i.e., changes from ‘1’ to ‘0’ or changes from ‘0’ to ‘1’).
