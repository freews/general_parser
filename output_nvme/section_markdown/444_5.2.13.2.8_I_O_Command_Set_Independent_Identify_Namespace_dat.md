###### 5.2.13.2.8 I/O Command Set Independent Identify Namespace data structure (CNS 08h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.13.2.8 | **Page**: 384-388

If the Namespace Identifier (NSID) field specifies an active NSID, then the I/O Command Set Independent
Identify Namespace data structure (refer to Figure 335) is returned to the host for that specified namespace.
If the value in the NSID field specifies an inactive NSID, then the controller returns a zero filled data
structure.
The Reported column in Figure 335 specifies fields in the I/O Command Set Independent Identify
Namespace data structure that define namespace capabilities used by a host to format or create a
namespace. If the NSID field is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller shall return an I/O Command Set
Independent Identify Namespace data structure that:
•
for fields in Figure 335 that indicate “Yes” in the Reported column, contain the same value for all
namespaces; and
•
for fields in Figure 335 that indicate “No” in the Reported column, contain a value cleared to 0h.
If the controller supports the Namespace Management capability (refer to section 8.1.16) and the NSID
field is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller shall return an I/O Command Set Independent Identify
Namespace data structure. If the controller does not support the Namespace Management capability and
the NSID field is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller may abort the command with a status code of Invalid
Namespace or Format.

| | | 7:6 | Reserved |
| | | | **Volatile Write Cache Not Present (VWCNP):** This bit indicates that a volatile write cache is not present for this namespace. |
| | | | If this bit is set to '1', then there is no volatile write cache present for this namespace and the host should ignore the Volatile Write Cache Present bit in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328) for this namespace. |
| | | 5 | If this bit is cleared to '0', then the presence of a volatile write cache for this namespace is defined in the Volatile Write Cache bit in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328). |
| | | | **Rotational Media (RMEDIA):** If this bit is set to '1', then the namespace stores data on rotational media (refer to section 8.1.25). If this bit is cleared to '0', then the namespace does not store data on rotational media. |

If this bit is cleared to '0', then the NGUID value may be reused and the EUI64 value may be reused by the controller for a new namespace created after this namespace is deleted.
