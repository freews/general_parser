##### 3.2.5.2 Domains and Reservations

> **Section ID**: 3.2.5.2 | **Page**: 110-110

If an NVM subsystem supports multiple domains and Persistent Reservations (refer to section 8.1.24), then
resumption after a division event (e.g., resumption of operation, resumption of communication) requires
that all persistent reservation state within the domains in the NVM subsystem that are no longer divided be
synchronized (i.e., updated).
If the reservation state for a namespace is not synchronized, then the ANA Group that contains that
namespace shall transition to the ANA Inaccessible state (refer to section 8.1.1.6) and remain in that state
until the Persistent Reservation state is synchronized. If the Persistent Reservation state is not able to be
synchronized, then:
•
a transition to the ANA Persistent Loss state occurs and commands are processed as described in
section 8.1.1.7; or
•
the controller may stop processing commands and set the Controller Fatal Status (CSTS.CFS) bit
to ‘1’ (refer to section 9.5).
