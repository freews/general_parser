##### 3.3.1.3 Queue Abort

> **Section ID**: 3.3.1.3 | **Page**: 113-113

To abort a large number of commands, the host may use:
•
the Cancel command (refer to section 7.1); or
•
delete and recreate the I/O Submission Queue (refer to section 3.7.3).
Specifically, to abort all commands that are submitted to an I/O Submission Queue, a host should:
•
issue a Cancel command to that queue with the Cancel Action set to Multiple Command Cancel
and the NSID field set to FFFFFFFFh; or
•
issue a Delete I/O Submission Queue command for that queue. After that submission queue has
been successfully deleted, indicating that all commands have been completed or aborted, then a
host should recreate the queue by submitting a Create I/O Submission Queue command. A host
may then re-submit commands to the associated I/O Submission Queue.
If the host is no longer able to communicate with the controller before that host receives either:
•
completions for all outstanding commands submitted on that I/O Submission Queue (refer to
section 3.4.5); or
•
a successful completion for the Delete I/O Submission Queue command for that I/O Submission
Queue,
then it is strongly recommended that the host take the steps described in section 9.6 to avoid possible data
corruption caused by interaction between outstanding commands and subsequent commands submitted
by that host to another controller.
