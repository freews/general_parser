##### 8.1.30.1 UUIDs for Vendor Specific Information Introduction

> **Section ID**: 8.1.30.1 | **Page**: 679-679

Several commands send or receive information that contains fields described as Vendor Specific or that is
specified by a command field containing a value in a vendor specific range. Examples include the Set
Features command, which may specify a vendor specific feature identifier, and the Identify command, which
may retrieve a data structure having a vendor specific area.
The vendor specific information may have different definitions (e.g., a vendor specific log page identifier
with the contents of the page defined differently by different entities, such as an NVM subsystem vendor
and an NVM subsystem customer). By associating each definition of the information with a UUID specified
by the defining entity, a command is able to specify the particular definition of the information.
A command specifies a particular definition of the information by specifying an index into a list of UUIDs
supported by the controller (refer to section 5.2.13.2.14). The NVMe Invalid UUID (refer to section 8.1.30.2)
is used to replace a previously valid UUID in the UUID List (refer to Figure 336). This is done to keep the
values in the list at a static index, as that index is used by the Host to access the UUID List contents.
NVM subsystem vendors and customers communicate (by means outside the scope of this specification)
the UUID used for each definition of the information.
