A keyword referring to bits, bytes, words, fields, and opcode values that are set-aside for future
standardization. Their use and interpretation may be specified by future extensions to this or other
specifications. A reserved bit, byte, word, field, property, or register shall be cleared to 0h, or in accordance
with a future extension to this specification. The recipient of a command or a controller property write is not
required to check reserved bits, bytes, words, or fields. Receipt of reserved coded values in defined fields
in commands shall be reported as an error. Writing a reserved coded value into a controller property field
produces undefined results.
