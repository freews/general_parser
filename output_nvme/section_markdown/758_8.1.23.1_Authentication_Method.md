##### 8.1.23.1 Authentication Method

> **Section ID**: 8.1.23.1 | **Page**: 638-638

A controller supports one Authentication Method as indicated in the Identify Controller data structure.
If the Authentication Method supported is HMAC SHA-256 (refer to RFC 6234), then the message
authentication code (MAC) is calculated using HMAC SHA-256 as defined in RFC 6234. The key used to
generate a MAC using HMAC SHA-256 is the 256-bit Authentication Key stored in the controller for the
selected RPMB target. The HMAC SHA-256 calculation takes as input a key and a message. Input to the
MAC calculation is the concatenation of the fields in the RPMB Data Frame (request or response) excluding
stuff bytes and the MAC itself – i.e., bytes [223:255] and Data of the frame in that order.
