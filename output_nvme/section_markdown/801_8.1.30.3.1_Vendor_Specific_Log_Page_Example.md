###### 8.1.30.3.1 Vendor Specific Log Page Example

> **Section ID**: 8.1.30.3.1 | **Page**: 681-681

If entity C and entity V create different definitions for a vendor specific log page having the same log page
identifier (e.g., D0h), then each assigns a UUID to distinguish their definition (e.g., entity V assigns UUID V
and entity C assigns UUID C).
A controller supporting both definitions of the log page:
a) Sets the UUID List bit to ‘1’ in the CTRATT field of the Identify Controller data structure (refer to
Figure 328);
b) Sets the UUID Selection Supported bit to ‘1’ in the Commands Supported and Effects data structure
(refer to Figure 214) corresponding to the Get Log Page command; and
c) Reports both UUID V and UUID C in the UUID list (refer to Figure 336).
A host requesting the log page defined by entity C:
A host requesting the log page defined by entity V:
A host not specifying the definition of the log page clears the UUID Index field to 0h. The selection of the
log page definition returned by the controller is vendor specific (e.g., the controller may select any definition
for the returned data).
