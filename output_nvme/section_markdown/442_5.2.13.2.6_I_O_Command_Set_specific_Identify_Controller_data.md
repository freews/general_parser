###### 5.2.13.2.6 I/O Command Set specific Identify Controller data structure (CNS 06h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.13.2.6 | **Page**: 384-384

An I/O Command Set specific Identify Controller data structure is returned to the host for the controller
processing the command. The specific Identify Controller data structure that is returned by this command
is specified by the Command Set Identifier (CSI) field (refer to Figure 327). Data structures for specific I/O
Command Sets are optionally defined by the NVM Express I/O Command Set specifications. If the I/O
Command Set specified by the CSI field does not have an Identify Controller data structure, then the
controller shall return a zero filled data structure. If the host requests a data structure for an I/O Command
Set that the controller does not support, the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid
Field in Command.
