###### 3.3.2.1.3 Data Transfers

> **Section ID**: 3.3.2.1.3 | **Page**: 116-116

Data may be transferred within capsules or by memory transfers. SGLs are used to specify the location of
data. Metadata, if transferred, is a contiguous part of the user data with which that metadata is associated.
The SGL descriptor(s) (refer to section 4.3.2) specify whether the command’s data is transferred through
memory or within the capsule. The capsule may contain either SGLs or data (not a mixture of both) following
the SQE. If additional SGLs are required, then the SGLs are included in the capsule immediately after the
SQE. If an invalid offset is specified in an SGL descriptor, then a status code of SGL Offset Invalid shall be
returned.
SGLs shall be supported within a capsule. The NVMe Transport binding specification defines the SGL
Descriptor Types and Sub Types that are supported for the corresponding NVMe Transport. The NVMe
Transport binding specification also specifies if SGLs may be supported in host memory.
