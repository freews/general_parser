###### 5.2.12.1.32.2.2 Implicitly Modified Reclaim Unit Handle (Event Type 81h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.32.2.2 | **Page**: 312-313

This FDP event indicates that the controller modified a Reclaim Unit Handle to reference a different Reclaim
Unit where that modification was not due to any host action (e.g., a write command that has a size greater
than the remaining capacity of the initial Reclaim Unit being written).
