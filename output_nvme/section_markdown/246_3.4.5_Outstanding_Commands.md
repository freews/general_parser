#### 3.4.5 Outstanding Commands

> **Section ID**: 3.4.5 | **Page**: 128-128

A command is outstanding if:
•
the host has submitted that command to the controller;
•
the host has not received a completion for that command; and
•
as described in this section:
o
the host has not performed an action that causes that command to no longer be outstanding;
and
o
the host has not otherwise determined that that command is no longer outstanding.
A submitted command is no longer outstanding after the host:
•
receives a completion for that command;
•
receives a successful completion with Immediate Abort Not Performed bit cleared to ‘0’ in Dword 0
of the completion queue entry for an Abort command specifying that outstanding command (refer
to section 5.2.1);
•
receives a successful completion with the Commands Aborted field set to 1h for a Cancel command
with an Action Code of Single Command Cancel and specifying that outstanding command (refer
to section 7.1);
•
reads a CSTS.RDY bit value that indicates a controller is not able to process commands except for
Fabrics commands (i.e., a value of ‘0’), if that outstanding command is not a Fabrics command
(refer to section 3.7.2);
•
reads a CSTS.SHST field value that indicates that the controller shutdown is complete (i.e., a value
of 10b), if that outstanding command is not a Fabrics command (refer to section 3.6.1 for memory-
based transports and section 3.6.2 for message-based transports);
•
if using a memory-based transport, receives a successful completion for a Delete I/O Submission
Queue command if that outstanding command was sent on the deleted I/O Submission queue
(refer to section 3.3.1.3); and
•
if using a message-based transport:
o
receives a successful completion for a Disconnect command if that outstanding command was
sent on the same I/O queue as the Disconnect command (refer to section 3.3.2.4); or
o
restores communication to the same controller after losing communication to that controller
(refer to section 3.9.5).
If an outstanding command ceases to be outstanding for one of these reasons, then further controller
processing of that command is no longer possible.
