###### 8.3.2.2.1 Push Registrations and Push De-Registrations

> **Section ID**: 8.3.2.2.1 | **Page**: 706-706

A push registration is performed using the Discovery Information Management command (refer to section
5.4.4) with the Task (TAS) field (refer to Figure 530) cleared to 0h to explicitly register discovery information
for a host or NVM subsystem with a Centralized Discovery controller (CDC) or explicitly register discovery
information for a host with a Direct Discovery controller (DDC).
A push de-registration is performed using the Discovery Information Management command with the TAS
field set to 1h to explicitly de-register discovery information for a host or NVM subsystem with a CDC or
explicitly de-register discovery information for a host with a DDC.
A DDC that performs push registrations or push de-registrations implements host functionality (e.g.
submitting commands, processing command completions, providing a Host NQN, etc.).
