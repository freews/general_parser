###### 5.4.8.1.2 Disassociate Namespace (Management Operation 02h)

> **Section ID**: 5.4.8.1.2 | **Page**: 504-504

The Disassociate Namespace operation of the Manage Exported Namespace command is used to remove
an association between an Exported Namespace ID (ENSID) and an Exported NVM Subsystem and delete
the Exported Namespace ID.
The data pointer shall point to a Disassociate Namespace data structure (refer to Figure 553).
If the Exported Namespace is attached to any controller, then the controller processing the command shall
abort the command with a status code of Command Sequence Error.
If the Disassociate Namespace data structure does not contain an Exported NVM Subsystem NQN
(SUBNQN) for an existing Exported NVM Subsystem associated with the specified Exported Namespace
ID and an Exported NSID associated with the specified Exported NVM Subsystem, then the controller shall
abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.
Upon successful completion of a Manage Exported Namespace command with a Disassociate Namespace
operation:
•
the specified Exported Namespace ID has been deleted; and
•
an Allocated Namespace Attribute Changed asynchronous event is reported as described in Figure
154.
