#### 3.8.3 Capacity Reporting

> **Section ID**: 3.8.3 | **Page**: 149-150

For an NVM subsystem that does not support multiple domains, the capacity information reported in the
Identify Controller data structure (i.e., the TNVMCAP field and the UNVMCAP field in Figure 328) describes
the capacity for the NVM subsystem. If the MEGCAP field is non-zero, that field indicates the largest entity
(e.g., Endurance Group, NVM Set, namespace that contains formatted storage) that may be created in the
NVM subsystem.
For an NVM subsystem that supports multiple domains, the capacity information reported in the Identify
Controller data structure describes the capacity accessible by the controller processing the Identify
command. The host may use the Identify command to access the Domain List data structure (refer to
section 5.2.13.2.15) to determine the domains that are accessible by the controller and the capacity
information for each of those domains. If the Max Endurance Group Domain Capacity field is non-zero,
then the field describes the largest entity (e.g., Endurance Group, namespace that contains formatted
storage) that may be created by this controller in the domain described by that Domain Attributes Entry.
For an NVM subsystem that supports Endurance Groups (refer to section 3.2.3), the host may use the
Identify command to access the Endurance Group List data structure (refer to section 5.2.13.2.16) to
determine the Endurance Groups that are accessible by the controller. To determine the capacity
information for each Endurance Group, the host uses the Get Log Page command to access the Endurance
Group Information log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.10).
For an NVM subsystem that supports NVM Sets (refer to section 3.2.2), the host may use the Identify
command to access the NVM Set List data structure (refer to section 5.2.13.2.4) to determine the NVM
Sets that are accessible by the controller and the capacity information for each of those NVM Sets.
For the management of Endurance Groups, NVM Sets, and namespaces that contain formatted storage,
Figure 89 describes the effects of the support of NVM Sets, Endurance Groups, and domains on which
capacity information is used for each management operation.
