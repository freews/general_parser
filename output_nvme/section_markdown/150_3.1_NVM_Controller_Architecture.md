### 3.1 NVM Controller Architecture

> **Section ID**: 3.1 | **Page**: 61-61

A controller is the interface between a host and an NVM subsystem. This specification defines two controller
models, the static controller model and the dynamic controller model. All controllers in an NVM subsystem
shall support the same controller model.
In an NVM subsystem that supports the static controller model, state (e.g., controller ID, saved Feature
settings) is preserved:
•
across a Controller Level Reset for memory-based controllers and message-based controllers; and
•
from prior associations for message-based controllers.
In an NVM subsystem that supports the dynamic controller model, the NVM subsystem allocates controllers
on demand with no state preserved from prior associations.
