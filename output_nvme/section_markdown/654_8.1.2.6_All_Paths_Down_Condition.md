##### 8.1.2.6 All Paths Down Condition

> **Section ID**: 8.1.2.6 | **Page**: 547-547

An all paths down condition occurs when there are no paths available on the host to access the namespaces
in an ANA Group (i.e., the NVM media). To determine whether an all paths down condition has occurred,
the host may examine the ANA log page on each controller that provides access to the namespaces in a
particular ANA Group. All paths that are not in the ANA Persistent Loss state should be checked. If no paths
to the namespaces in that ANA Group become available (i.e., transition to the ANA Optimized state or the
ANA Non-Optimized state) for the duration of an ANATT time interval, then an all paths down condition has
occurred for the namespaces in that ANA Group.
