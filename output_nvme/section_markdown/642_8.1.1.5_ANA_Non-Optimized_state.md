##### 8.1.1.5 ANA Non-Optimized state

> **Section ID**: 8.1.1.5 | **Page**: 542-542

While the relationship between the controller and an ANA group is in this state, the characteristic of that
relationship to each namespace in that group is non-optimized. Commands processed by a controller that
reports this state for an ANA Group provide non-optimized access characteristics (e.g., the processing of
some commands, especially those involving data transfer, may operate with lower performance or may use
NVM subsystem resources less effectively than if a controller is used that reports the optimized state) to
any namespace in that ANA Group. Support for reporting this state is optional.
While in this state, all commands, functions, and operations supported by the namespace shall perform as
described in this specification.
