##### 8.1.9.4 Data Placement (Directive Type 02h, Optional)

> **Section ID**: 8.1.9.4 | **Page**: 586-586

The Data Placement Directive enables the host to specify to the controller the Reclaim Unit (refer section
8.1.11) to place the user data in I/O commands specified by the applicable NVM Express I/O Command
Set specification.
The Data Placement Directive has no Directive Operations defined. Any Directive Receive command or
Directive Send command that specifies the Data Placement Directive in the Directive Type (DTYPE) field
in Command Dword 11 shall be aborted by the controller with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.
If a Directive Send command to enable the Data Placement Directive is processed (refer to section
8.1.9.2.2.1) and the specified namespace is not contained in an Endurance Group with Flexible Data
Placement enabled, then the controller shall abort the Directive Send command with a status code of FDP
Disabled.
