##### 3.1.4.25 Offset E0Ch: PMREBS – Persistent Memory Region Elasticity Buffer Size

> **Section ID**: 3.1.4.25 | **Page**: 98-99

This optional property identifies to the host the size of the PMR elasticity buffer. A value of 0h in this property
indicates to the host that no information regarding the presence or size of a PMR elasticity buffer is
available.
This property shall not be reset by a Controller Level Reset initiated by a Controller Reset.
