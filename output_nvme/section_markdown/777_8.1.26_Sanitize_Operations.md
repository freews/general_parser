#### 8.1.26 Sanitize Operations

> **Section ID**: 8.1.26 | **Page**: 653-654

A sanitize operation alters all user data in the sanitization target such that recovery of any previous user
data is prohibitively difficult (i.e., infeasible for a given level of effort (refer to IEEE Std 2883)). The scope
of a sanitize operation is different for an NVM subsystem sanitize operation (refer to section 1.5.70) and for
a namespace sanitize operation (refer to section 1.5.65) as shown in Figure 704.
Performing a namespace sanitize operation on every namespace that exists in the NVM subsystem does
not have the same effect upon certain portions of data in the NVM subsystem as performing an NVM
subsystem sanitize operation (e.g., namespace sanitize operations have no effect on the Controller Memory
Buffer). If a namespace sanitize operation has been performed on every namespace that exists in the NVM
subsystem and no user data has been written to any of those namespaces since each namespace sanitize
operation completed successfully, then the Global Data Erased bit (refer to Figure 302) in the Sanitize
Status log page for the sanitization target of the NVM subsystem shall not be set ‘1’ as a result of
successfully completing those namespace sanitize operations.
For an NVM subsystem sanitize operation, it is implementation specific whether Submission Queues and
Completion Queues within a Controller Memory Buffer are altered; all other data stored in all Controller
Memory Buffers is altered by that NVM subsystem sanitize operation. If a portion of the user data, that was
required to be altered, was not altered and the NVM subsystem sanitize operation completed successfully,
then the NVM subsystem shall ensure permanent inaccessibility of that portion of the media in the NVM
subsystem that is allocated for user data for any future use within the NVM subsystem (e.g., retrieval from
NVM media, caches, or any Controller Memory Buffer) and permanent inaccessibility of that portion of the
media in the NVM subsystem that is allocated for user data via any interface to the NVM subsystem,
including management interfaces as defined by the NVM Express Management Interface Specification.
If the composition of the NVM subsystem (refer to section 3.2.5) changes (e.g., a new domain is added, or
a division event occurs) and that change prevents the successful completion of a sanitize operation, then
the sanitize operation shall fail. If the composition of the NVM subsystem changes and that change does
not prevent the successful completion of a sanitize operation, then that NVM subsystem composition
change does not cause the sanitize operation to fail.
If the composition of the NVM subsystem changes (e.g., a new domain is added, or a division event occurs)
and that change prevents verification of media in the sanitization target that is allocated for user data, then
the Media Verification state is canceled and the MVCNCLD bit is set to ‘1’.
Sanitize operations do not affect the Replay Protected Memory Block, boot partitions, or other media and
caches that do not contain user data. A sanitize operation also may alter log pages and features as
necessary (e.g., to prevent derivation of user data from log page information or feature information). A
sanitize operation is only able to be started if the NVM subsystem does not have a division (refer to section
3.2.5) that prevents successfully processing a sanitize operation (refer to section 8.1.26.1). A sanitize
operation in the Restricted Processing state, the Unrestricted Processing state, the Media Verification state,
or the Post-Verification Deallocation state is not able to be aborted and continues after a Controller Level
Reset, including across power cycles. Refer to Annex A for further information about sanitize operations.
