##### 5.2.1.1 Immediate Abort requirements

> **Section ID**: 5.2.1.1 | **Page**: 201-201

If the controller performs an immediate abort, then the controller shall ensure that, other than the posting
of the completion queue entry for the command to abort, there are no effects of that command (e.g., no
host memory access, command processing does not modify: NVM media, NVM Set state, Endurance
Group state, namespace state, controller state, domain state, or NVM subsystem state) subsequent to the
posting of the CQE for the command that requested the abort. If the controller is not able to ensure there
are no effects of the command to abort subsequent to the posting of the CQE for the command that
requested the abort, then the controller shall not perform an immediate abort on that command.
For example, if a command:
•
requests a data transfer;
•
the data transfer has been initiated and not completed; and
•
the CQE for that command was not posted prior to the posting of the CQE for the command that
requested the abort,
then the controller is prohibited from performing an immediate abort.
Performing an immediate abort effects the information returned in the CQE for the command that requested
the abort as described in section 5.2.1.2 for an Abort command and in section 7.1.1 for a Cancel command.
