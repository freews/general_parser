###### 8.3.1.1.2.3 DNS TXT record

> **Section ID**: 8.3.1.1.2.3 | **Page**: 700-700

The DNS TXT record provides additional information about the instance using key/value pairs in the form
of “key=value” separated by commas (refer to section 6.4 in RFC 6763).
For NVMe over Fabrics, the DNS TXT record shall include a key/value pair for protocol (p) and may include
a key/value pair describing an NQN.
DNS TXT record key/value pairs:
Protocol (p): the protocol field shall indicate the IP transport protocols that are supported by the
Discovery controller being advertised. For example:
“p=tcp”, “p=roce”, or “p=iwarp”.
NQN: the DNS TXT record may contain an nqn key/value pair. When it is included the NQN
provided shall be set to the unique NQN of the Discovery subsystem if one is available for use.
Otherwise, the well-known Discovery Service NQN (nqn.2014-08.org.nvmexpress.discovery) may
be used.
As described in RFC 6763, the format of the data within a DNS TXT record is one or more strings, packed
together without any intervening gaps or padding bytes for word alignment.
The format of a TXT record that may be provided in a response is:
“<length byte>p=tcp<length byte>nqn=NQN.of.Discovery.subsystem”.
Using this format, an example of a TXT record that may be provided in a response is:
“05p=tcp1Enqn=NQN.of.Discovery.subsystem”.
