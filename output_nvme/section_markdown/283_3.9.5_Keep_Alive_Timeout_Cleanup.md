#### 3.9.5 Keep Alive Timeout Cleanup

> **Section ID**: 3.9.5 | **Page**: 155-155

If a controller detects a Keep Alive Timeout, then the controller shall perform the following actions within
the time specified by the CQT field (refer to Figure 328):
•
record an Error Information Log Entry with the status code Keep Alive Timeout Expired;
•
stop processing commands;
•
set the Controller Fatal Status (CSTS.CFS) bit to ‘1’; and
•
for message-based transports:
o
terminate the NVMe Transport connections for this association; and
o
break the host to controller association.
For message-based transports, after completing these steps, a controller may accept a Connect command
(refer to section 6.3) for the Admin Queue from the same or another host in order to form a new association.
If a host detects a Keep Alive Timeout and has outstanding commands for which that host has not received
completions (refer to section 3.4.5), then it is strongly recommended that the host takes steps described in
section 9.6 to avoid possible data corruption caused by interaction between outstanding commands and
subsequent commands submitted by that host to another controller.
