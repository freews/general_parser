> **Section ID**: 1.5.19 | **Page**: 31-31

For memory-based transport model (e.g., PCIe) implementations, a command is submitted when a
Submission Queue Tail Doorbell write has completed that moves the Submission Queue Tail Pointer value
past the Submission Queue slot in which the command was placed.
For message-based transport model (e.g., NVMe over Fabrics) implementations, a command is submitted
when a host adds a capsule to a Submission Queue.
