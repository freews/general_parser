##### 4.2.3.2 Command Specific Status Definition

> **Section ID**: 4.2.3.2 | **Page**: 170-174

Completion queue entries with a Status Code Type (SCT) of Command Specific Errors indicate an error
that is specific to a particular command opcode. Status codes of 00h to 7Fh are for Admin command errors
(refer to Figure 103). Status codes of 80h to BFh are specific to the selected I/O command sets (refer to
Figure 104).
Fabrics command errors use status codes of 80h to BFh (refer to Figure 105) and Admin command error
status codes (refer to Figure 103).
Some Fabrics command errors use Admin command error status codes (refer to Figure 103).
