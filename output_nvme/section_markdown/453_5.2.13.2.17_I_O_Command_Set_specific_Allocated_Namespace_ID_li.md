###### 5.2.13.2.17 I/O Command Set specific Allocated Namespace ID list (CNS 1Ah)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.13.2.17 | **Page**: 392-392

A list of up to 1,024 namespace IDs is returned to the host containing allocated NSIDs in increasing order
that are greater than the value specified in the Namespace Identifier (NSID) field of the Identify command
and as specified by the Command Set Identifier (CSI) field of the command. Only NSIDs for namespaces
associated with the I/O Command Set specified in CSI are returned. For CSI values not supported by the
controller the command is aborted with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.
The controller should abort the command with a status code of Invalid Namespace or Format if the NSID
field is set to FFFFFFFEh or FFFFFFFFh. The NSID field may be cleared to 0h to retrieve a Namespace
List including the namespace starting with NSID of 1h. The data structure returned is a Namespace List
(refer to section 4.6.2).
