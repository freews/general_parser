##### 3.3.3.4 Queue Coordination

> **Section ID**: 3.3.3.4 | **Page**: 124-124

There is one Admin Queue pair associated with multiple I/O queue pairs. The Admin Submission Queue
and Completion Queue are used to carry out functions that impact the entire controller. An I/O Submission
Queue and Completion Queue may be used to carry out I/O (read/write) operations and may be distributed
across CPU cores and threads.
An Admin command may impact one or more I/O queue pairs. The host should ensure that Admin actions
are coordinated with threads that are responsible for the I/O queue pairs to avoid unnecessary error
conditions. The details of this coordination are outside the scope of this specification.
