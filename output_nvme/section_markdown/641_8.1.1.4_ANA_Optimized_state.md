> **Section ID**: 8.1.1.4 | **Page**: 542-542

While the relationship between the controller and an ANA group is in this state, the characteristic of that
relationship to each namespace in that group is optimized. Commands processed by a controller that
reports this state for an ANA Group provide optimized access characteristics to any namespace in that ANA
Group. A controller that supports ANA Reporting shall support reporting this state.
While in this state, all commands, functions, and operations supported by the namespace shall perform as
described in this specification.
