##### 3.2.1.7 I/O Command Set Associations

> **Section ID**: 3.2.1.7 | **Page**: 103-103

A namespace is associated with exactly one I/O Command Set. For I/O commands and I/O Command Set
specific Admin commands, the I/O Command Set with which a submission queue entry is associated is
determined by the Namespace Identifier (NSID) field in the command.
An NVM subsystem may contain namespaces each of which is associated with a different I/O Command
Set. A controller may support attached namespaces that use any of the I/O Command Sets that the
controller simultaneously supports as indicated in the I/O Command Set Profile (refer to section
5.2.26.1.17).
