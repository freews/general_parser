##### 9.6.3.2 Command Retry Categories and Requirements

> **Section ID**: 9.6.3.2 | **Page**: 770-771

For command retry purposes, an outstanding command is in one of three categories:
•
Unrestricted Retry: The outstanding command is an idempotent command (refer to section
9.6.3.1) that is able to be retried without restrictions because that outstanding command has no
effect on user data or NVM subsystem state (e.g., an NVM Command Set Read command). Refer
to section 9.6.3.2.1.
•
Delayed Retry: The outstanding command is an idempotent command for which any retry and/or
reporting of the result of that retry is required to be delayed until no further controller processing is
possible of that outstanding command because the outstanding command modifies user data or
NVM subsystem state (e.g., an NVM Command Set Write command, except as described in section
9.6.3.2.2). Refer to section 9.6.3.2.2.
•
State-Dependent Retry: The outstanding command is not an idempotent command (e.g., a
Namespace Management command that creates a namespace) or is an idempotent command that
is able to affect behavior of other hosts. The procedures for recovery from such an outstanding
command depend on the extent, if any, to which that outstanding command has been processed
by the controller. Refer to section 9.6.3.2.3.
Sections 9.6.3.2.1, 9.6.3.2.2, and 9.6.3.2.3 define each command retry category and describe host
requirements and restrictions that prevent retry of outstanding commands from corrupting user data or
making unintended changes to NVM subsystem state.
