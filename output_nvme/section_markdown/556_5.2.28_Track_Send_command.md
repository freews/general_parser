The Track Send command is used to manage the tracking of information by a controller (e.g., what to track
during the migration of a controller in an NVM subsystem).
The Track Send command uses the Command Dword 10 field. The use of the Data Pointer field and
Command Dword 11 field is specific to the management operation specified by the Select field. All other
command specific fields are reserved.
The Select field defined in Figure 492 specifies the management operation to be performed. Refer to section
