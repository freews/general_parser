###### 5.4.9.1.1 Delete (Management Operation 01h)

> **Section ID**: 5.4.9.1.1 | **Page**: 505-505

The Delete operation of the Manage Exported NVM Subsystem command is used to delete a specified
Exported NVM Subsystem. The data buffer for the Delete operation of the Manage Exported NVM
Subsystem command contains an NVM Subsystem NQN specifying the Exported NVM Subsystem to be
deleted.
The Management Operation Specific field in Command Dword 10 is reserved and not used by this
operation.
If a Manage Exported NVM Subsystem command is processed that specifies the Delete operation without
specifying an existing Exported NVM Subsystem identified by the NVM Subsystem NQN (SUBNQN) in the
data buffer, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.
If there are:
•
any active controllers in the specified Exported NVM Subsystem;
•
any associations of Exported Namespaces in the specified Exported NVM Subsystem; or
•
any Exported Ports exist in the specified Exported NVM Subsystem,
then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Command Sequence Error.
Upon successful completion of a Manage Exported NVM Subsystem command with a Delete operation the
Exported NVM Subsystem identified shall be deleted.
