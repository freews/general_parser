If a namespace sanitize operation fails (i.e., the sanitization target enters the Restricted Failure state or the
Unrestricted Failure state):
•
all controllers shall process Admin commands as specified for Sanitize Namespace Admin
command processing restrictions in section 5.1.2 except that commands are aborted with a status
code of Sanitize Namespace Failed; and
•
all controllers shall abort all I/O commands specifying the NSID of a sanitization target that is in the
Restricted Failure state or the Unrestricted Failure state with a status code of Sanitize Namespace
Failed.
