#### 4.2.1 Admin Command and I/O Command Common CQE

> **Section ID**: 4.2.1 | **Page**: 164-165

The Common Completion Queue Entry Layout is at least 16 bytes in size. Figure 96 describes the layout
of the first 16 bytes of the completion queue entry data structure which follows the Common Completion
Queue Entry Layout. The contents of Dword 0 and Dword 1 are command specific. If a command uses
Dword 0 or Dword 1, then the definition of these dwords is contained within the associated command
definition. If a command does not use Dword 0 or Dword 1, then the unused field(s) are reserved. Dword 2
is defined in Figure 97 and Dword 3 is defined in Figure 98.
If a completion queue entry is constructed via multiple writes, the Phase Tag bit shall be updated in the last
write of that completion queue entry.
