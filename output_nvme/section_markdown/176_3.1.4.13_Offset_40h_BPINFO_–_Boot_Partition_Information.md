| | RO | 00b | **Boot Read Status (BRS)**: This field indicates the status of Boot Partition read operations initiated by the host writing to the BPRSEL.BPID field. Refer to section 8.1.3.<br><br>The boot read status values are defined as:<br><br> | |
| | | | <table><tbody><tr><th>Value</th><th>Definition</th></tr><tr><td>00b</td><td>No Boot Partition read operation requested</td></tr><tr><td>01b</td><td>Boot Partition read in progress</td></tr><tr><td>10b</td><td>Boot Partition read completed successfully</td></tr><tr><td>11b</td><td>Error completing Boot Partition read</td></tr></tbody></table> |
| | | | If a host writes the BPRSEL.BPID field, this field transitions to 01b. After successfully completing a Boot Partition read operation (i.e., transferring the contents to the boot memory buffer), the controller sets this field to 10b. If there is an error completing a Boot Partition read operation, this field is set to 11b, and the contents of the boot memory buffer are undefined. |
| | RO | 0h | Reserved |
| | RO | Impl Spec | **Boot Partition Size (BPSZ)**: This field defines the size of each Boot Partition in multiples of 128 KiB. Both Boot Partitions are the same size. |
