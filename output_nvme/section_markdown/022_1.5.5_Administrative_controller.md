#### 1.5.5 Administrative controller

> **Section ID**: 1.5.5 | **Page**: 30-30

A controller that exposes capabilities that allow a host to manage an NVM subsystem. An Administrative
controller does not implement I/O Queues, provide access to data or metadata associated with user data
on a non-volatile storage medium, or support namespaces attached to the Administrative controller (i.e.,
there are never any active NSIDs).
