##### 3.1.4.18 Offset 5Ch: CMBEBS – Controller Memory Buffer Elasticity Buffer Size

> **Section ID**: 3.1.4.18 | **Page**: 94-94

This optional property identifies to the host the size of the CMB elasticity buffer. A value of 0h in this property
indicates to the host that no information regarding the presence or size of a CMB elasticity buffer is
available.
