The host sends a Request Message Type to the controller to request an operation by the controller or to
deliver data to be written into the RPMB memory block. To deliver a Request Message Type, the host uses
the Security Send command. If the data to be delivered to the controller is more than reported in Identify
Controller data structure, the host sends multiple Security Send commands to transfer the entire data.
The host sends a Response Message Type to the controller to read the result of a previous operation
request, to read the Write Counter, or to read data from the RPMB memory block. To deliver a Response
Message Type, the host uses the Security Receive command. If the data to be read from the controller is
more than reported in Identify Controller data structure, the host sends multiple Security Receive
commands to transfer the entire data.
