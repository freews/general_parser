#### 1.5.21 controller

> **Section ID**: 1.5.21 | **Page**: 31-31

A controller is the interface between a host and an NVM subsystem. There are three types of controllers:
a) I/O controllers;
b) Discovery controllers; and
c) Administrative controllers.
A controller executes commands submitted by a host on a Submission Queue and posts a completion on
a Completion Queue. All controllers implement one Admin Submission Queue and one Admin Completion
Queue. Depending on the controller type, a controller may also implement one or more I/O Submission
Queues and I/O Completion Queues. When PCI Express is used as the transport, then a controller is a PCI
Express function.
