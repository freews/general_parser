### 7.3 I/O Management Receive command

> **Section ID**: 7.3 | **Page**: 528-528

The I/O Management Receive command is used to receive information from the controller used by the host
to manage I/O. The behavior of the command is dependent on the specified operation as defined in the
Management Operation field in Figure 595.
The command uses the Data Pointer, Command Dword 10, and Command Dword 11 fields. All other
command specific fields are reserved. If the command uses PRPs for the data transfer, then the PRP Entry
1 and PRP Entry 2 fields are used. If the command uses SGLs for the data transfer, then the SGL Entry 1
field is used. All other command specific fields are reserved.
If the Number of Dwords (NUMD) field corresponds to a length that is less than the size of the data structure
to be returned, then only that specified portion of the data structure is transferred. If the NUMD field
corresponds to a length that is greater than the size of the associated data structure, then the entire contents
of the data structure are transferred and no additional data is transferred, unless otherwise specified.
