| The power threshold is equal to the value in the Power Threshold Value field multiplied by the scale indicated in the Power Threshold Scale field. | |
| If this bit is cleared to '0', then there is no request: | |
| • to collect interval power measurements of the specified power measurement type for use in this Feature; and | |
| • for a Power Threshold Exceeded event to be reported by the controller. | |
| If a Power Threshold Exceeded event is reported, then the current value of this bit for this Feature shall be cleared to '0' (i.e., the current value for this bit only enables a single occurrence of a Power Threshold Exceeded event). | |
