#### 8.1.28 Standard Vendor Specific Command Format

> **Section ID**: 8.1.28 | **Page**: 675-675

Controllers may support the standard Vendor Specific command format defined in Figure 82. Host storage
drivers may use the Number of Dwords fields to ensure that the application is not corrupting physical
memory (e.g., overflowing a data buffer). The controller indicates support of this format in the Identify
Controller data structure in Figure 328; refer to the Admin Vendor Specific Command Configuration field
and the I/O Command Set Vendor Specific Command Configuration field.
