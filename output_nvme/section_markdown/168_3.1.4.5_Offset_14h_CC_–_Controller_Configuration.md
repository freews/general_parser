> **Section ID**: 3.1.4.5 | **Page**: 82-86

This property modifies settings for the controller. A host shall set the Arbitration Mechanism Selected
(CC.AMS), the Memory Page Size (CC.MPS), and the I/O Command Set Selected (CC.CSS) to valid values
prior to enabling the controller by setting CC.EN to ‘1’. Attempting to create an I/O queue before initializing
the I/O Completion Queue Entry Size (CC.IOCQES) and the I/O Submission Queue Entry Size
(CC.IOSQES) shall cause a controller to abort a Create I/O Completion Queue command or a Create I/O
Submission Queue command with a status code of Invalid Queue Size.
