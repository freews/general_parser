#### 2.3.2 I/O Command Sets

> **Section ID**: 2.3.2 | **Page**: 55-55

I/O commands perform operations on namespaces, and each namespace is associated with exactly one
I/O command set. For example, commands in the NVM Command Set access data represented in a
namespace as logical blocks, and commands in the Key Value Command Set access data represented in
a namespace as key-value pairs.
The association of a namespace to an I/O command set is specified when the namespace is created and
is fixed for the lifetime of that namespace.
A controller may support one or more I/O command sets. Namespaces that are associated with the I/O
command sets that are supported and enabled on a controller may be attached to that controller. A host
issues commands to a namespace and those commands are interpreted based on the I/O command set
associated with that namespace.
