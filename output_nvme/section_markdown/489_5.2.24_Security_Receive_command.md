#### 5.2.24 Security Receive command

> **Section ID**: 5.2.24 | **Page**: 420-421

The Security Receive command transfers the status and data result of one or more Security Send
commands that were previously submitted to the controller.
The association between a Security Receive command and previous Security Send commands is
dependent on the Security Protocol. The format of the data to be transferred is dependent on the Security
Protocol. Refer to SPC-5 for Security Protocol details.
Each Security Receive command returns the appropriate data corresponding to a Security Send command
as defined by the rules of the Security Protocol. The Security Receive command data may not be retained
if there is a loss of communication between the controller and host, or if a Controller Level Reset occurs.
If the Configurable Device Personality feature is supported (refer to section 5.2.26.1.24) and the Security
Personality is supported (refer to section 5.2.12.1.28), then the Security Receive command may have
additional command processing considerations as described in section 5.2.26.1.24.3.
The fields used are Data Pointer, Command Dword 10, and Command Dword 11 fields. All other command
specific fields are reserved.
