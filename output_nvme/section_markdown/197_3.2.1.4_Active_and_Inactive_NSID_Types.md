##### 3.2.1.4 Active and Inactive NSID Types

> **Section ID**: 3.2.1.4 | **Page**: 101-101

For a specific controller, an allocated NSID is:
a) an active NSID; or
b) an inactive NSID.
Active NSIDs for a controller refer to namespaces that are attached to that controller. Allocated NSIDs that
are inactive for a controller refer to namespaces that are not attached to that controller.
Unallocated NSIDs are inactive NSIDs for all controllers in the NVM subsystem.
An allocated NSID may be an active NSID for some controllers and an inactive NSID for other controllers
in the same NVM subsystem if the namespace that the NSID refers to is attached to some controllers, but
not all controllers, in the NVM subsystem.
Refer to section 8.1.16 for actions associated with a namespace being detached or deleted.
