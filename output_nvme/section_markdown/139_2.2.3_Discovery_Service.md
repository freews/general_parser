#### 2.2.3 Discovery Service

> **Section ID**: 2.2.3 | **Page**: 48-48

NVMe over Fabrics defines a discovery mechanism that a host uses to determine the NVM subsystems
that expose namespaces that the host may access. The Discovery Service provides a host with the
following capabilities:
•
The ability to discover a list of NVM subsystems with namespaces that are accessible to the host;
•
The ability to discover multiple paths to an NVM subsystem;
•
The ability to discover controllers that are statically configured;
•
The optional ability to establish explicit persistent connections to the Discovery controller; and
•
The optional ability to receive Asynchronous Event Notifications from the Discovery controller.
A Discovery Service is an NVM subsystem that supports only Discovery controllers (refer to section 3.1.3.3)
and shall not support any other controller type.
The method that a host uses to obtain the information necessary to connect to the initial Discovery Service
is implementation specific. This information may be determined using a host configuration file, a hypervisor
or OS property, or some other mechanism.
