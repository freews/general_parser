#### 3.4.1 Command Ordering Requirements

> **Section ID**: 3.4.1 | **Page**: 124-124

Commands which are not part of a fused operation (refer to section 3.4.2) and which comply with atomic
operations requirements (refer to section 3.4.3), are processed as independent entities without reference
to other commands submitted to the same I/O Submission Queue or to commands submitted to other I/O
Submission Queues. For example, the controller is not responsible for checking the LBA of an NVM
Command Set Read command or Write command to ensure any type of ordering between commands. If a
Read command is submitted for LBA x and there is a Write command also submitted for LBA x, there is no
guarantee of the order of completion for those commands (the Read command may finish first or the Write
command may finish first). If there are ordering requirements between these commands, a host or the
associated application is required to enforce that ordering above the level of the controller.
