###### 8.3.2.3.8.3.5 Pull Model DDC Discovery Log Page Request

> **Section ID**: 8.3.2.3.8.3.5 | **Page**: 728-729

A Pull Model DDC retrieves a discovery log page from the CDC through a Pull Model DDC Request
asynchronous event notification (refer to Figure 154). The CDC responds to that asynchronous event
notification with a Get Log Page command requesting the Pull Model DDC Request log page (refer to
section 5.2.12.3.6), to which the DDC responds with a log page requesting a Discovery Log Page Request
operation. The Discovery Log Page Request operation is then completed by the CDC by issuing a SDLP
command (refer to section 5.2.20) to provide the requested discovery log page to the DDC, as shown in
Figure 774.
The format of the operation specific parameters of a Pull Model DDC Request log page requesting a Log
Page Request operation is shown in Figure 775.
The LPRLID field and the LPRLSP field have respectively the same format and semantics of the LID field
and the LSP field in Command Dword 10 of a Get Log Page command. For example, to retrieve the Host
Discovery log page, the LPRLID field is set to 71h.
