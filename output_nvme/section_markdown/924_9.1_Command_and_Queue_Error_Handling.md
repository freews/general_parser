### 9.1 Command and Queue Error Handling

> **Section ID**: 9.1 | **Page**: 766-766

In the case of serious error conditions, such as a command that specifies an invalid Completion Queue, the
operation of the associated Submission Queue or Completion Queue may be compromised. In this case,
the host should delete the associated Completion Queue and/or Submission Queue. The delete of a
Submission Queue aborts all outstanding commands associated with that Submission Queue, and deletion
of either queue type (i.e., Submission Queue, or Completion Queue) releases resources associated with
that queue. The host should recreate the Completion Queue and/or Submission Queue to then continue
with operation.
In the case of serious error conditions for Admin commands, the entire controller should be reset using a
Controller Level Reset. The entire controller should also be reset if a completion is not received for the
deletion of a Submission Queue or Completion Queue.
For most command errors, there is not an issue with the Submission Queue and/or Completion Queue
itself. Thus, the host and the controller should continue to process commands. It is at the discretion of the
host whether to retry the failed command; the Retry bit in the completion queue entry indicates whether a
retry of the failed command may succeed.
