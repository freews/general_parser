###### 8.3.1.3.5 DDC response to mDNS queries

> **Section ID**: 8.3.1.3.5 | **Page**: 702-702

A DDC may respond to mDNS queries for the service names of:
“_nvme-disc.<protocol>.local”
mDNS responses to queries for these service names shall contain the information described in section
8.3.1.1.2.
DDCs should ignore mDNS queries for the service name of “_ddcpull._sub._nvme-disc.<protocol>.local”
(refer to Figure 733), as the subtype “_ddcpull._sub” is obsolete.
