###### 5.2.26.2.3 Interrupt Vector Configuration (Feature Identifier 09h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.2.3 | **Page**: 469-469

This Feature configures settings specific to a particular controller interrupt vector. The settings are specified
in Command Dword 11.
By default, coalescing settings are enabled for each interrupt vector. Interrupt coalescing is not supported
for the Admin Completion Queue.
If a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure 475 are returned
in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command for the Interrupt Vector specified in Command
Dword 11.
Prior to issuing a Set Features command that specifies this Feature, the host shall configure the specified
Interrupt Vector with an I/O Completion Queue (refer to section 5.3.1). If the specified Interrupt Vector is
invalid, or not associated with an existing I/O Completion Queue (refer to Figure 504), then the controller
should abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.
