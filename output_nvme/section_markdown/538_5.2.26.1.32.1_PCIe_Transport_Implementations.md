###### 5.2.26.1.32.1 PCIe Transport Implementations

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.32.1 | **Page**: 464-464

The Host Identifier is an optional feature when implemented on a controller using a PCIe transport. The
controller may support a 64-bit Host Identifier and/or an extended 128-bit Host Identifier. It is recommended
that implementations support the extended 128-bit Host Identifier as indicated in the Controller Attributes
field in the Identify Controller data structure.
The Host Identifier for PCIe transport implementations shall have a default value of 0h and shall not have
a saved value. NVM Express Base Specification, Revision 2.0 and earlier allowed saving a Host Identifier
value, if a non-zero Host Identifier value had been saved then that saved value shall be reset to the default
value.
