##### 8.1.18.2 Autonomous Power State Transitions

> **Section ID**: 8.1.18.2 | **Page**: 613-613

The controller may support autonomous power state transitions, as indicated in the Identify Controller data
structure in Figure 328. Autonomous power state transitions provide a mechanism for the host to configure
the controller to automatically transition between power states on certain conditions without software
intervention.
The entry condition to transition to the Idle Transition Power State is that the controller has been in idle for
a continuous period of time exceeding the Idle Time Prior to Transition time specified. The controller is idle
when there are no commands outstanding to any I/O Submission Queue. If a controller has an operation in
process (e.g., device self-test operation) that would cause controller power to exceed that advertised for
the proposed non-operational power state, then the controller should not autonomously transition to that
state.
The power state to transition to shall be a non-operational power state (a non-operational power state may
autonomously transition to another non-operational power state). If an operational power state is specified
by a Set Features command specifying the Autonomous Power State Transitions feature (i.e., the Feature
Identifier field set to 0Ch (refer to section 5.2.26.1.6), then the controller should abort the command with a
status code of Invalid Field in Command. Refer to section 8.1.18.1 for more details.
