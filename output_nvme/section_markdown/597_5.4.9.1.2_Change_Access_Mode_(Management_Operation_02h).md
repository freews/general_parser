###### 5.4.9.1.2 Change Access Mode (Management Operation 02h)

> **Section ID**: 5.4.9.1.2 | **Page**: 505-506

The Change Access Mode operation of the Manage Exported NVM Subsystem command is used to change
the access mode of an Exported NVM Subsystem to:
•
allow all hosts access to the specified Exported NVM Subsystem; or
•
restrict access to specified hosts listed in the Allowed Host List associated to the specified Exported
NVM Subsystem.
The data buffer for the Change Access Mode operation of the Manage Exported NVM Subsystem command
specifies an NVM Subsystem NQN indicating the Exported NVM Subsystem for which the Access Mode is
to be changed. The Management Operation Specific field in Command Dword 10 for the Change Access
Mode operation is shown in Figure 556.
The Restricted Access bit defined in Figure 556 specifies the access setting for the Exported NVM
Subsystem:
•
A value of ‘0’ in the Restricted Access bit configures this Exported NVM Subsystem with
Unrestricted Access. This value shall enable all hosts to access the specified Exported NVM
Subsystem.
•
A value of ‘1’ in the Restricted Access bit shall restrict access of Exported NVM Subsystem to
entries in the Allowed Host List associated to the specified Exported NVM Subsystem. Any
connected host not in the Allowed Host List associated to the specified Exported NVM Subsystem
shall be disconnected from all Exported Namespaces in the Exported NVM Subsystem.
If a Manage Exported NVM Subsystem command is processed that specifies the Change Access Mode
operation without specifying an existing Exported NVM Subsystem in the NVM Subsystem NQN (SUBNQN)
field, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.
Upon successful completion of a Manage Exported NVM Subsystem command with a Change Access
Mode operation, the access mode for the specified Exported NVM Subsystem shall be set to the value
specified in the Restricted Access bit in the Management Operation Specific field.
