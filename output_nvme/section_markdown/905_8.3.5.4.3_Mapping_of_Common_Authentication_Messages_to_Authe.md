> **Section ID**: 8.3.5.4.3 | **Page**: 746-746

The AUTH_Negotiate message and the AUTH_Failure2 message are sent from the host to the controller,
therefore they are mapped to the Authentication Send command. The AUTH_Failure1 message is sent
from the controller to the host, therefore it is mapped to the Authentication Receive command.
