###### 5.2.13.2.7 I/O Command Set specific Active Namespace ID list (CNS 07h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.13.2.7 | **Page**: 384-384

A list of 1,024 namespace IDs is returned to the host containing active NSIDs in increasing order that are
greater than the value specified in the Namespace Identifier (NSID) field of the command as specified by
the Command Set Identifier (CSI) field of the command. Only namespaces associated with the I/O
Command Set specified by the CSI value are returned. For CSI values that are not supported or not enabled
the command is aborted with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.
The controller should abort the command with a status code of Invalid Namespace or Format if the NSID
field is set to FFFFFFFEh or FFFFFFFFh. The NSID field may be cleared to 0h to retrieve a Namespace
List including the namespace starting with NSID of 1h. The data structure returned is a Namespace List
(refer to section 4.6.2).
