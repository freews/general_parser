###### 5.2.13.2.1 Identify Controller Data Structure (CNS 01h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.13.2.1 | **Page**: 345-381

The Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328) is returned to the host for the controller processing
the command.
Figure 329 defines the power state descriptor that describes the attributes of each power state. For more
information on how the power state descriptor fields are used, refer to section 8.1.18 on power
management. If the controller supports the Power Limit feature (refer to section 5.2.26.1.25), then the
number and contents of the power state descriptors depends on the current attributes of that Feature as
specified in section 8.1.18.6.

For memory-based controllers, this field is reserved.<br>• Mandatory for Discovery controllers that support explicit persistent connections. For Discovery controllers that do not support explicit persistent connections this field is reserved.<br>• For Discovery controllers, the TBKAS bit is optional, and all other bits are reserved.<br>• If a Discovery controller returns a non-null value for either the Serial Number (SN) or Model Number (MN) fields, that Discovery controller shall return a non-null value for both of those fields. |
| | | | | Figure 329 defines the power state descriptor that describes the attributes of each power state. For more information on how the power state descriptor fields are used, refer to section 8.1.18 on power management. If the controller supports the Power Limit feature (refer to section 5.2.26.1.25), then the number and contents of the power state descriptors depends on the current attributes of that Feature as specified in section 8.1.18.6. |

| Max Bandwidth (MBW): This field specifies the maximum bandwidth (i.e., the highest bandwidth attainable in this power state when submitting MDT$S$-length sequential read commands at a queue depth of Optimal Aggregated Queue Depth field (refer to Figure 328)). The bandwidth is equal to the value in this field multiplied by the scale indicated in the MBWS field. A value of 0h indicates no maximum bandwidth is reported. | |

| Emergency Power Fail Vault Time Scale (EPFVTS): This field indicates the scale for the Emergency Power Fail Vault Time field as defined in Figure 330. | |
| If the EPFVT field is cleared to 0h, then this field: | |
| • shall be cleared to 0h; and | |
| • is ignored by the host. | |
| Forced Quiescence Vault Time Scale (FQVTS): This field indicates the scale for the Forced Quiescence Vault Time field as defined in Figure 330. | |
| If the FQVT field is cleared to 0h, then this field: | |
| • shall be cleared to 0h; and | |
| • is ignored by the host. | |
| Emergency Power Fail Recovery Time Scale (EPFRTS): This field indicates the scale for the Emergency Power Fail Recovery Time field as defined in Figure 330. | |
| If the EPFRT field is cleared to 0h, then this field: | |
| • shall be cleared to 0h; and | |
| • is ignored by the host. | |
| Emergency Power Fail Vault Time (EPFVT): This field, with the EPFVTS field, indicates the worst-case time required for the controller to complete Emergency Power Fail Processing (refer to section 8.2.5.3) in the absence of failures. The time is equal to the value in this field multiplied by the scale indicated by the EPFVTS field. | |
| If Power Loss Signaling with Emergency Power Fail is not supported (i.e., the PLSEPF bit is cleared to '0' in the Power Loss Signaling Information field of the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328)), then this field shall be cleared to 0h. | |
