###### 8.1.9.3.2.1 Release Identifier (Directive Operation 01h)

> **Section ID**: 8.1.9.3.2.1 | **Page**: 585-586

The Release Identifier operation specifies that the stream identifier specified in the DSPEC field in
command Dword 11 is no longer in use by the host. Specifically, if the host uses that stream identifier in a
future operation, then that stream identifier is referring to a different stream. If the specified identifier does
not correspond to an open stream for the specified namespace, then the Directive Send command should
not fail as a result of the specified identifier. If there are stream resources allocated for the exclusive use of
the specified namespace, then those exclusive stream resources remain allocated for this namespace and
may be re-used in a subsequent write command. If there are no stream resources allocated for the exclusive
use of the specified namespace, then the stream resources are returned to the NVM subsystem stream
resources for future use by a namespace without exclusive allocated stream resources. If an NSID value
of FFFFFFFFh is specified, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field
in Command.
No data transfer occurs.
