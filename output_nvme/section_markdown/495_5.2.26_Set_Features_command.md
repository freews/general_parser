#### 5.2.26 Set Features command

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26 | **Page**: 422-425

The Set Features command specifies the attributes of the Feature indicated.
The Set Features command uses the Data Pointer, Command Dword 10, and Command Dword 14. The
use of Command Dword 11, Command Dword 12, Command Dword 13, and Command Dword 15 fields is
Feature specific. If Command Dword 11, Command Dword 12, Command Dword 13, or Command Dword
15 fields are not used, then the Command Dwords are reserved.
If the controller supports selection of a UUID by the Set Features command (refer to Figure 403 and section
8.1.30) and the controller supports selection of a UUID for:
•
the specified vendor specific feature identifier (refer to Figure 403); or
•
vendor-specific attributes within a Feature (e.g., vendor-specific personalities in the Configurable
Device Personality feature as defined in section 5.2.26.1.24) defined by this specification or any
applicable NVM Express I/O Command Set specification,
then Command Dword 14 is used to specify a UUID Index value (refer to Figure 402).
If the controller does not support selection of a UUID by the Set Features command or the controller does
not support selection of a UUID for:
•
the specified vendor specific feature identifier; or
•
vendor-specific attributes within a Feature defined by this specification or any applicable NVM
Express I/O Command Set specification,
then Command Dword 14 does not specify a UUID Index value.
Figure 403 defines the Features that are able to be configured with a Set Features command and retrieved
with a Get Features command.
Section 5.2.26.1 describes features that are common to all transport models. Section 5.2.26.2 describes
features that are specific to the Memory-based transport model. Section 5.2.26.3 describes features that
are specific to the Message-based transport model.
