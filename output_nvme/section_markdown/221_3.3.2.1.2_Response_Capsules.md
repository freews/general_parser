###### 3.3.2.1.2 Response Capsules

> **Section ID**: 3.3.2.1.2 | **Page**: 115-116

A response capsule is sent from the NVM subsystem to the host. It contains a completion queue entry
(CQE) and may optionally contain data. The CQE is the completion queue entry associated with a
previously issued command capsule.
If a command requests data and the SGL in the associated command capsule specifies a Data Block
descriptor with an Offset, the data is included in the response capsule. If the SGL(s) in the command
capsule specify a region in host memory, then data is transferred via memory transactions.
The completion queue entry is 16 bytes in size and contains a two byte status field.
The definition for the completion queue entry for a Fabrics command is shown in section 4.2.2. The
definition for the completion queue entry when the command is an Admin command or I/O command is
defined in section 4.2.1, where the SQ Identifier and Phase Tag fields are reserved because they are not
used in NVMe over Fabrics. Use of the SQHD field depends on whether SQ flow control is disabled for the
queue pair, refer to section 6.3.
