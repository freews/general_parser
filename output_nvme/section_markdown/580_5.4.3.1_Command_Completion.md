##### 5.4.3.1 Command Completion

> **Section ID**: 5.4.3.1 | **Page**: 491-491

Upon completion of the Cross-Controller Reset command, the controller posts a CQE to the Admin
Completion Queue indicating the status for the Cross-Controller Reset command.
If the command completes successfully, Dword 0 of the CQE indicates information about the Cross-
Controller Reset operation as shown in Figure 527.
If the value of the ICID field in the Cross-Controller Reset command is the same as the controller ID of the
Source Controller, the Source Controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in
Command. If:
•
the value of the ICID field in the Cross-Controller Reset command is the same as the value of the
ICID field in a pre-existing entry in the Cross-Controller Reset log page; and
•
the Cross-Controller Reset Status (CCRS) field in that entry is set to In Progress,
the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Cross-Controller Reset in Progress.
Cross-Controller Reset command specific status values are defined in Figure 528.
