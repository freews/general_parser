##### 3.2.5.4 Domain Identifier Use (Informative)

> **Section ID**: 3.2.5.4 | **Page**: 111-111

Domain Identifier values indicate the parts of the NVM subsystem that comprise a domain.
The host may use these values to determine which Endurance Groups (refer to section 3.2.3) are contained
in the same domain and which are contained in a different domain. Examples of host use of the domain
identifier include:
•
host data redundancy software (e.g., RAID) that may use the Endurance Group’s Domain Identifier
to determine which Endurance Groups may fail together (e.g., Endurance Groups in the same
domain) and which Endurance Groups may fail independently (e.g., Endurance Groups in different
domains); and
•
host application software may use the controller’s Domain Identifier to determine which controllers
share domains (e.g., controllers that may fail together) and which controllers are a part of different
domains (e.g., controllers that may fail independently).
