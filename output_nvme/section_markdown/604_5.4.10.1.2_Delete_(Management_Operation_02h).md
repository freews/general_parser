###### 5.4.10.1.2 Delete (Management Operation 02h)

> **Section ID**: 5.4.10.1.2 | **Page**: 510-511

The Delete operation of the Manage Exported Port command is used to remove an Exported Port from an
Exported NVM Subsystem and delete the Exported Port.
The Exported Port to be deleted is specified in the Exported Port ID (EPID) field in the Delete operation
data structure (refer to Figure 566) in the data buffer.
The Exported NVM Subsystem NQN to which this Exported Port ID is assigned is specified in the NVM
Subsystem NVMe Qualified Name (SUBNQN) field of the Delete operation data structure in the data buffer.
The Exported Port that is deleted by a Delete operation should not be in use (i.e., there should be no
association between any host and a controller through that Exported Port). If the Exported Port is in use,
then all associations between any host and a controller through that port are terminated by the Delete
operation, and for any association that is terminated, the behavior of outstanding commands submitted via
that association and resources underlying that association (e.g., fabric connections) is undefined.
If:
•
the Exported port ID field in the Delete operation data structure does not contain an Exported Port
ID associated with the Exported NVM Subsystem NQN (SUBNQN) specified in the Delete data
structure (refer to Figure 566); or
•
the NVM Subsystem NVMe Qualified Name field in the Delete data structure (refer to Figure 566)
does not contain an NVM Subsystem NQN for an existing Exported NVM Subsystem that is
associated with the Exported Port ID specified in the Delete data structure,
then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.
Upon successful completion of a Manage Exported Port command with a Delete operation the specified
Exported Port ID has been removed from the specified Exported NVM Subsystem.
