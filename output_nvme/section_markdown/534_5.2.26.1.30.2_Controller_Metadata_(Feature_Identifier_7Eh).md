###### 5.2.26.1.30.2 Controller Metadata (Feature Identifier 7Eh)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.26.1.30.2 | **Page**: 461-461

This Feature is used to store controller metadata about the host platform for later retrieval.
The Controller Metadata Feature provides backward compatibility with Management Controllers (refer to
the NVM Express Management Interface Specification) compliant with version 1.1 and earlier versions of
the NVM Express Management Interface Specification.
If a controller supports both the Enhanced Controller Metadata Feature and the Controller Metadata
Feature, then the Controller Metadata Feature should not be used by the host.
The metadata element types defined in Figure 463 are used by this Feature.
Refer to section 5.2.26.1.30 for the definitions of Command Dword 11 and the Host Metadata data structure.
If a Set Features command’s Element Action field of Command Dword 11 is set to 10b (Add Entry Multiple),
then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command and shall not
change the Host Metadata Feature value.
The default value for the Number of Metadata Element Descriptors of the Controller Metadata Feature shall
be 0h on a Controller Level Reset.
If a Get Features command with the SEL field set to 011b (i.e., Supported Capabilities) with the Controller
Metadata Feature value is submitted, then the NS Specific bit in Dword 0 of the corresponding completion
queue entry shall be cleared to ‘0’.
