##### 8.3.2.4 Asynchronous Events

> **Section ID**: 8.3.2.4 | **Page**: 729-729

A Centralized Discovery controller (CDC) reports a Discovery Log Page Change Asynchronous Event
notification (Asynchronous Event Information field set to F0h) to each host that has requested
asynchronous event notifications of this type (refer to Figure 154) as specified in section 3.1.3.3.2 when a
Fabric Zoning configuration changes. In particular:
•
if a Zone member with the Role set to 2h (i.e., an NVM subsystem) is added or removed from a
Zone, then the CDC shall report an AEN to all Zone members of that Zone having the Role set to
1h (i.e., all hosts in that Zone);
•
if a Zone member with the Role set to 1h (i.e., a host) is added or removed from a Zone, then the
CDC shall report an AEN to all Zone members of that Zone having the Role set to 2h (i.e., all NVM
subsystems in that Zone); and
•
If a Zone is added or removed, then the CDC shall report an AEN to all Zone members of the added
or removed Zone.
