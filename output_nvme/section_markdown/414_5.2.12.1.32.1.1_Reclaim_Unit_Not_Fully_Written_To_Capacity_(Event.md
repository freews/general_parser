> **Section ID**: 5.2.12.1.32.1.1 | **Page**: 312-312

This FDP event indicates that the Reclaim Unit Handle reported in the Placement Identifier (refer to Figure
289 and Figure 290) was modified to reference a different Reclaim Unit due to an I/O Management Send
command issued by the host prior to the previously referenced Reclaim Unit being written to capacity.
