###### 5.2.13.2.21 Supported Controller State Formats (CNS 20h)

> **Section ID**: 5.2.13.2.21 | **Page**: 393-394

A Supported Controller State Formats data structure (refer to Figure 345) is returned to the host identifying
the supported NVMe Controller State data structures (refer to Figure 346) and a list of UUIDs that identifies
the vendor specific controller state information.
A host uses an index into each list to identify the format and information returned by a Migration Receive
command specifying the Get Controller State management operation (refer to section 5.2.16.1.1).
A host uses an index into each list to identify the format and information contained in a Migration Send
command specifying the Set Controller State management operation of the Migration Send command (refer
to section 5.2.17.1.3).
