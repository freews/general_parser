###### 8.1.18.6.3 Updating a Power Limit Without Changing Prohibited or Enabled Power States

> **Section ID**: 8.1.18.6.3 | **Page**: 619-619

If controller processing of the Power Limit feature (e.g., processing of a Set Features command for this
feature or processing a Controller Level Reset) does not cause any prohibited power state to become
enabled and does not cause any enabled power state to become prohibited (i.e., results in a power limit
value that is less than or equal to the value of the MP field in the PSD0 field in the Identify Controller data
structure and that is greater than or equal to the value of MP field in every RPSD data structure for any
prohibited power state), then the controller:
•
shall update the attributes of the Power Limit feature; and
•
shall not change the Power State Descriptor data structures, the NPSS field, or any attribute of the
Power Management feature.
