Examples of host use of the domain\nidentifier include:\n•\nhost data redundancy software (e.g., RAID) that may use the Endurance Group’s Domain Identifier\nto determine which Endurance Groups may fail together (e.g., Endurance Groups in the same\ndomain) and which Endurance Groups may fail independently (e.g., Endurance Groups in different\ndomains); and\n•\nhost application software may use the controller’s Domain Identifier to determine which controllers\nshare domains (e.g., controllers that may fail together) and which controllers are a part of different\ndomains (e.g., controllers that may fail independently).",
