    "text": "In configurations that consist of multiple NVM subsystems, the burden on administrators is reduced by\nenabling hosts to automatically retrieve the list of NVM subsystem ports the host has been allowed to\naccess from a centralized location. This centralized location is referred to as a Centralized Discovery\ncontroller (CDC).\nHosts and NVM subsystems may become known to the CDC by explicitly registering their discovery\ninformation as the result of a push registration (refer to section 8.3.2.2.1). If a host or Direct Discovery\ncontroller (DDC) detects the presence of multiple CDCs, then that host or DDC should register their\ndiscovery information with each CDC. Alternatively, the CDC may implicitly register discovery information\nas a result of processing a Connect command from a host, or as a result of receiving a pull registration\nrequest from a DDC (refer to section 8.3.2.2.2).\nThe CDC may filter the list of NVM subsystem ports returned in response to a Get Log Page command\nfrom the host that requests the Discovery log page to include only the NVM subsystem ports that provide\naccess to namespaces allocated to that host. The process used to configure this filtering function is known\nas Fabric Zoning (refer to section 8.3.2.3.\nAn overview of the registration and discovery process is described in section 8.3.2.1.1.",
