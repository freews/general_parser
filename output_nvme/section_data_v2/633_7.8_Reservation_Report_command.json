    "text": "The Reservation Report command returns a Reservation Status data structure to memory that describes\nthe registration and reservation status of a namespace.\nIf the namespace is not a dispersed namespace, then the size of the Reservation Status data structure is\na function of the number of registrants of the namespace (i.e., there is a Registrant data structure and/or\nRegistrant Extended data structure for each such registrant). If the namespace is a dispersed namespace\nthat is able to be accessed by controllers in multiple participating NVM subsystems, then the size of the\nReservation Status data structure is a function of the number of registrants of the namespace in the NVM\nsubsystem containing the controller processing the command and the number of registrants of the\nnamespace in each separate participating NVM subsystem. The controller returns the data structure in\nFigure 615 if the host has selected a 64-bit Host Identifier and the data structure in Figure 616 if the host\nhas selected a 128-bit Host Identifier (refer to section 5.2.26.1.32).\nFor controllers compliant with NVM Express Base Specification, Revision 2.0 and earlier, registrants of the\nnamespace that are not associated with any controller in the NVM subsystem may or may not be reported\nby this command.\nIf a 64-bit Host Identifier has been specified and the Extended Data Structure bit is set to ‘1’ in Command\nDword 11, then the controller shall abort the command with the status code of Host Identifier Inconsistent\nFormat. If a 128-bit Host Identifier has been specified and the Extended Data Structure bit is cleared to ‘0’\nin Command Dword 11, then the controller shall abort the command with the status code of Host Identifier\nInconsistent Format.\nThe command uses Command Dword 10 and Command Dword 11. If the command uses PRPs for the\ndata transfer, then PRP Entry 1 and PRP Entry 2 fields are used. If the command uses SGLs for the data\ntransfer, then the SGL Entry 1 field is used. All other command specific fields are reserved.",
