The Admin Completion Queue is created by specifying its base address\nin the ACQ property. If a PRP List is provided to describe the CQ, then the PRP List shall be maintained by\nthe host at the same location in host physical memory and the values in the PRP List shall not be modified\nuntil the corresponding Delete I/O Completion Queue command for this CQ is completed successfully or\nthe controller is reset. If the PRP List values are modified, the behavior is undefined.\nThe Create I/O Completion Queue command uses the PRP Entry 1, Command Dword 10, and Command\nDword 11 fields. All other command specific fields are reserved.",

This is a 0's based value. | |\n| Queue Identifier (QID): This field indicates the identifier to assign to the Completion Queue to be Completion Queues. If the value specified is 0h, exceeds the Number of Queues reported, or corresponds to an identifier already in use, the controller should return an error of Invalid Queue Identifier. | |\n| Description | |\n| Interrupt Vector (IV): This field's value is transport specific and is described in the applicable NVMe Transport binding specification if required. If not defined by the transport, then this field shall be cleared to 0h. | |\n| Reserved | |\n| Interrupts Enabled (IEN): If this bit is set to '1', then interrupts are enabled for this Completion Queue. If this bit is cleared to '0', then interrupts are disabled for this Completion Queue. | |\n| Physically Contiguous (PC): If this bit is set to '1', then the Completion Queue is physically contiguous | |\n| If the: <br> • queue is located in the Controller Memory Buffer; <br> • PC is cleared to '0'; and <br> • CMBLOC.CQPDS is cleared to '0', | |\n| then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Use of Controller Memory Buffer. | |"
