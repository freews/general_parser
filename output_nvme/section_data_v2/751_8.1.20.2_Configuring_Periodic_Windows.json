    "text": "When using the NVM Set in Predictable Latency Mode, the host should transition the controller to NDWIN\nfor periodic maintenance. The maintenance is required in order for the NVM subsystem to reliably provide\nthe amount of time indicated for Deterministic Windows.\nThere are three static time based parameters reported in the Predictable Latency Per NVM Set log page\n(refer to section 5.2.12.1.11) that may be used by the host to configure periodic windows. The values\nprovided are worst-case for the life of the NVM subsystem:\n•\nNDWIN Time Minimum Low is the minimum time that the NVM Set remains in the Non-Deterministic\nWindow. The controller may delay completion of a Set Features command requesting a transition\nto the Deterministic Window until this time is completed. This time does not account for additional\nhost activity in the Non-Deterministic Window;\n•\nNDWIN Time Minimum High is the minimum time that the host should allow the NVM Set to remain\nin the Non-Deterministic Window after the NVM Set remained in the previous Deterministic Window\nfor DTWIN Time Maximum. This time does not account for additional host activity in the Non-\nDeterministic Window; and\n•\nDTWIN Time Maximum is the maximum time that the NVM Set is able to stay in a Deterministic\nWindow.\nThe DTWIN Time Maximum and NDWIN Time Minimum High may provide a ratio of the amount of\nmaintenance that needs to be performed based on the time that the NVM Set remains in the DTWIN,\nassuming no threshold is exceeded. Any scaling of the time in the Non-Deterministic Window based on the\nread, write, and time behavior in the previous Deterministic Window is implementation dependent.\nThe DTWIN Time Estimate may be used by the host when a Deterministic Excursion has occurred. This\nestimate allows the host to re-synchronize an NVM Set with other NVM Sets operating in Predictable\nLatency Mode, if applicable.",
