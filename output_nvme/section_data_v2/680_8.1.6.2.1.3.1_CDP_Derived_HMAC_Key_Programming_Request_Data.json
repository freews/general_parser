This field shall be set to the CDP Response Data Frame common fields with the CDP Request Message Type field set to a value of 4h (i.e., Derived HMAC Key Programming Response). |\n| | This field contains the value that represents the position of the corresponding bit in the CDPALG bitmask (e.g., a value of '0h' corresponds to the HMAC-SHA-384 algorithm). |\n| | **Host Programmed Key Size (HPKS):** This field specifies the size in bytes of the host-programmed key in the HPK field.<br>The size of the host-programmed key is dependent on the CDP Authentication Algorithm used (refer to Figure 642). |\n| | **Host Programmed Key (HPK):** This field specifies the value of the host-programmed key. The value of this field is the host-programmed key used by the controller to calculate the DHK. |"
