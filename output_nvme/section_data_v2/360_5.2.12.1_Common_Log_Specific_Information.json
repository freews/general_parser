Log pages that\nindicate a scope of controller return information that is specific to the controller that is processing the\ncommand. Some log pages that contain information about other controllers indicate a scope of controller\n(e.g., the Cross-Controller Reset log page, refer to section 5.2.12.3.1) because that information is\nmaintained by the controller that processes the command and returns the log page. Log pages that indicate\na scope of Namespace return information that is specific to the specified namespace. For log pages that\nindicate multiple scopes, support for multiple domains or the namespace identifier that is specified\ndetermines which information is returned. The definition of any individual field within a log page may indicate\na different scope that is specific to that individual field.\nFor log pages with a scope of NVM subsystem or controller (as shown in Figure 206), the controller shall\nabort commands that specify namespace identifiers other than 0h or FFFFFFFFh with a status code of\nInvalid Field in Command. Otherwise, the rules for namespace identifier usage in Figure 92 apply.",
