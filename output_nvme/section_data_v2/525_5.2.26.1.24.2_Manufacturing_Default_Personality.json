    "text": "The Manufacturing Default Personality allows a host to change the settings of all supported personalities\nto the manufacturing default value (refer to Figure 449). This personality is used to ensure all settings of all\npersonalities are changed to the manufacturing default values. The Manufacturing Default Personality\nchanges the feature current value for all supported personalities to the feature default value and may also\nchange other settings outside of the feature current values (e.g., vendor-specific settings that are not visible\nto the host, settings that are not indicated by the feature values but are indicated to the host via other\nmechanism such as Identify Controller). Setting the feature current value of each supported personality,\nother than the Manufacturing Default Personality, to the feature default value may or may not change these\nother personality settings to the manufacturing default values.\nIf a Set Features command specifying the Configurable Device Personality feature requests the\nManufacturing Default Personality is successfully processed, then the controller shall set the Personality\nManufacturing Default Settings State (PMDSS) bit to ‘1’ for all supported personalities (refer to Figure 449).\nThe Manufacturing Default Personality is required to be supported by the controller, if the Configurable\nDevice Personality feature is supported, and may be frozen or unfrozen during manufacturing.\nThe following conditions are required for the host to be able to change all personalities to the manufacturing\ndefault settings using the Manufacturing Default Personality. If any of these conditions are not met, a Set\nFeatures command requesting the Manufacturing Default Personality shall be aborted with a status code\nof Feature Not Changeable:\n•\nall personalities that are capable of being unfrozen (refer to AUS field in Figure 285) are unfrozen\n(i.e., the PERFS bit is cleared to ‘0’ for all supported personalities as defined in Figure 284); and\n•\nall conditions necessary to change a personality, as defined by each personality, must be met for\nall supported personalities (e.g., the specified security protocol for the Security Personality is reset\nto the default security settings as specified for the given security protocol (refer to section\n5.2.26.1.24.3).\nSome personalities may have an effect on user data when changing configurations as indicated by the\nPersonality Settings Change User Data Effect (PSCUDE) bit (refer to Figure 285).\nIf the Derived HMAC Key (DHK) is programmed in the NVM subsystem (refer to section 8.1.6.3.1), then\nthat DHK shall be purged (refer to IEEE Std 2883) as part of the NVM subsystem successfully being\nconfigured with the Manufacturing Default Personality. The DHK shall not be purged by any other operation\n(e.g., as part of a sanitize operation or Format NVM command).",
