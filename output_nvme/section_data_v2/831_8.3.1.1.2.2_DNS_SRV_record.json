    "text": "The DNS SRV record provides the TCP port where the service instance can be reached and shall have a\nname in the form of:\n“<Instance>.<Service>.<Domain>”.\nInstance (Instance name) is a vendor defined human readable string. Although use of a serial number is\ndiscouraged in DNS-Based Service Discovery (refer to RFC 6763), an instance name that may be\nmeaningful to an IT administrator is a combination of the Model Number (MN), Serial Number (SN) and\nPhysical Fabric Interface (Physical Ports). For example:\n“SubsystemIF-SerialNumber-SubsystemModel”.\nThe maximum length of the Instance Name field is 63 bytes (refer to RFC 6763).\nThe <Service> portion of the name (refer to section 4.1 of RFC 6763) can be further broken down into:\n“<service name>.<protocol>”.",
