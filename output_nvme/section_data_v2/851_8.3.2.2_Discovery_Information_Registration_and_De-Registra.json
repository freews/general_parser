    "text": "Discovery information registration is the process of registering host or NVM subsystem discovery\ninformation with a Centralized Discovery controller (CDC) or registering host discovery information with a\nDirect Discovery controller (DDC).\nDiscovery information registration may be performed:\n•\nusing a push registration (refer to section 8.3.2.2.1); or\n•\nusing a pull registration (refer to section 8.3.2.2.21).\nInformation from a Connect command (e.g., Host NQN) may be retained by a Discovery controller to provide\na limited set of discovery information. If the Discovery controller determines that the host that submitted the\nConnect command is the same as a host for which the Discovery controller has retained host discovery\ninformation from a previous push registration, then the Discovery controller should continue to retain that\nhost discovery information.\nA host:\n•\nshould use push registrations to register host discovery information with a CDC or DDC; and\n•\nis not able to use pull registrations to register discovery information.\nA CDC:\n•\nmay use push registrations to register host discovery information with a DDC; and\n•\nshall not use pull registrations to register discovery information.\nA DDC:\n•\nshould use push registrations when registering NVM subsystem discovery information with a CDC;\nor\n•\nmay use pull registrations when registering NVM subsystem discovery information with a CDC.\nDiscovery information de-registration is the process of de-registering host or NVM subsystem discovery\ninformation with a CDC or de-registering host discovery information with a DDC.\nDiscovery information de-registration may be performed using one of the following methods:\n•\na push de-registration (refer to section 8.3.2.2.1); or\n•\na pull de-registration (refer to section 8.3.2.2.2).\nA host:\n•\nmay use push de-registrations to de-register host discovery information with a CDC or DDC; and\n•\nis not able to use pull de-registrations to de-register discovery information.\nA CDC:\n•\nmay use push de-registrations to de-register host discovery information with a DDC; and\n•\nshall not use pull de-registrations to de-register discovery information.\nA DDC:\n•\nshould use push de-registrations to de-register NVM subsystem discovery information with a CDC;\nor\n•\nmay use pull de-registrations to de-register NVM subsystem discovery information with a CDC.",
