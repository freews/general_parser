    "text": "Figure 626 shows an overview of the Boot Partition write protection states for each Boot Partition when only\nRPMB Boot Partition Write Protection is supported.\nIf Set Features Boot Partition Write Protection is not supported by the controller, then prior to enabling\nRPMB Boot Partition Write Protection, the default state for all Boot Partitions is the Write Unlocked state. If\nSet Features Boot Partition Write Protection is also supported by the controller, then the default state for\nall Boot Partitions is the Write Locked state, regardless of whether RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection\nhas been enabled or not. Refer to section 8.1.3.3.1 for more details on Boot Partition write protection when\nRPMB Boot Partition Write Protection is disabled and section 8.1.3.3.3 for additional considerations when\nboth Boot Partition write protection capabilities are supported.\nIf Set Features Boot Partition Write Protection is not supported by the controller, then all Boot Partitions\nremain unlocked until RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection is enabled by the host. A host enables RPMB\nBoot Partition Write Protection by setting the Boot Partition Write Protection Enabled bit in the RPMB Device\nConfiguration Block data structure (refer to section 8.1.23). Once RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection is\nenabled, the controller shall reject Authenticated Device Configuration Block Writes that attempt to disable\nthe RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection mechanism (i.e., enabling RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection\nis permanent). Once RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection is enabled, Boot Partitions are able to be\nmodified only after write unlocking the Boot Partition using RPMB.\nAfter enabling RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection:\nc) The default state for all Boot Partitions is the Write Locked state. In this state, a host may read a\nBoot Partition. In this state, the controller rejects attempts to write to a Boot Partition using the\nFirmware Commit command;\nd) Each Boot Partition may be locked or unlocked independently using the corresponding bit in the\nDevice Configuration Block data structure. A Boot Partition may be unlocked in the same command\nthat enables RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection; and\ne) If any Boot Partition has been unlocked, a power cycle or Controller Level Reset event results in\nthat Boot Partition becoming write locked.",
