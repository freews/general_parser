The segment where the extended device\nself-test operation resumes is vendor specific, but implementations should only have to perform tests again\nwithin the last segment that was being tested prior to the reset.\nAn extended device self-test operation:\na) shall be aborted by a Format NVM command as described in Figure 644;\nb) shall be aborted when a sanitize operation is started (refer to section 5.2.22);\nc) shall be aborted if a Device Self-test command with the Self-Test Code field set to Fh is processed;\nand\nd) may be aborted if the specified namespace is removed from the namespace inventory.",
