    "text": "Controller processing of an idempotent command produces the same end state on the NVM subsystem\nand returns the same results if that command is resubmitted one or more times with no intervening\ncommands. All commands tend to modify some ancillary state on the controller (e.g., tracking statistics);\nthese ancillary changes to state do not prevent a command from being considered idempotent. The results\nof the command include the status code (excluding transient status codes or error conditions, e.g., due to\na loss of communication), any data returned to the host and any NVM subsystem changes to user data or\nstate (e.g., reservation state, feature contents).\nFor example, a read command addressed to a specific location (e.g., LBA) in a namespace is an idempotent\ncommand. The read command addressed to a valid location in a namespace returns the same data with a\nsuccessful completion status code if that command is submitted repeatedly. Similarly, a write command\naddressed to a valid location in a namespace writes the same data to that location if submitted repeatedly.\nThis command is also an idempotent command.\nOn the other hand, a Namespace Management command (refer to section 5.2.21) that creates a\nnamespace is not idempotent (i.e., is a non-idempotent command), as repeating the Namespace\nManagement command creates additional namespaces with different namespace identifiers. Similarly, a\nReservation Register command that unregisters a host (refer to section 7.6) is also not idempotent because\nrepeating the command attempts to unregister a host that is no longer registered and returns an error status\ncode.",
