    "text": "The doorbell stride, specified in CAP.DSTRD (refer to Figure 36), may be used to separate doorbells by a\nnumber of bytes in memory space. The doorbell stride is a number of bytes equal to (2 ^ (2 + CAP.DSTRD)).\nThis is useful in software emulation of an NVM Express controller. In this case, a software thread is\nmonitoring doorbell notifications. The software thread may be made more efficient by monitoring one\ndoorbell per discrete cacheline or utilize the monitor/mwait CPU instructions. For hardware implementations\nof the NVM Express interface, the expected doorbell stride value is 0h.",
