If this bit is set to '1', then the controller supports Boot Partitions. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller does not support Boot Partitions. Refer to section 8.1.3. |\n| | RO | Impl Spec | **Command Sets Supported (CSS):** This field indicates the I/O Command Set(s) that the controller supports.<br>For Discovery controllers, this field should have only the NCSS bit set to '1'.<br> | Bits | Description |\n| | | | | | No I/O Command Set Support (NOIOCSS): This bit indicates whether no I/O Command Set is supported (i.e., only the Admin Command Set is supported).<br>This bit shall be set to '1' if no I/O Command Set is supported. |\n| | | | | | I/O Command Set Support (IOCSS): This bit indicates whether the controller supports one or more I/O Command Sets and supports the Identify I/O Command Set data structure (refer to section 5.2.13.2.19).

Controllers that only support the NVM Command Set may set this bit to '1'. |\n| | | | | | 5:1 | Reserved |\n| | | | | | 0 | NVM Command Set Support (NCSS): This bit indicates whether the controller supports the NVM Command Set or a Discovery controller. |\n| | RO | Impl Spec | **NVM Subsystem Reset Supported (NSSRS):** This bit indicates whether the controller supports the NVM Subsystem Reset feature defined in section 3.7.1. This bit is set to '1' if the controller supports the NVM Subsystem Reset feature. This bit is cleared to '0' if the controller does not support the NVM Subsystem Reset feature.<br>For Discovery controllers, this field shall be cleared to 0h. |\n| | RO | Impl Spec | **Doorbell Stride (DSTRD):** Each Submission Queue and Completion Queue Doorbell property is 32-bits in size. This property indicates the stride between doorbell properties. The stride is specified as (2 ^ (2 + DSTRD)) in bytes. A value of 0h indicates a stride of 4 bytes, where the doorbell properties are packed without reserved space between each property. Refer to section 8.2.2.<br>For message-based controllers, this field shall be cleared to a fixed value of 0h. |\n| | | | |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| | | | |\n| | | | |\n| | | | |\n| | | | |\n| | | | |\n| | | | |"
