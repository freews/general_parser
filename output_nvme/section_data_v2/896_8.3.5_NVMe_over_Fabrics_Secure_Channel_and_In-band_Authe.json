    "text": "NVMe over Fabrics supports both fabric secure channel (that includes authentication) and NVMe in-band\nauthentication. Fabric authentication is part of establishing a fabric secure channel via an NVMe Transport\nspecific protocol that provides authentication, encryption, and integrity checking (e.g., IPsec; refer to RFC\n4301 or TLS; refer to RFC 8446). NVMe in-band authentication is performed immediately after a Connect\ncommand (refer to section 6.3) succeeds using the Authentication Send and Authentication Receive\ncommands (refer to section 6.1 and section 6.2) to tunnel authentication protocol commands between the\nhost and the controller.\nEnrollment of the host and controller in an authentication mechanism, including provisioning of\nauthentication credentials to the host and controller, is outside the scope of this specification.\nIf both fabric secure channel and NVMe in-band authentication are used, the identities for these two\ninstances of authentication may differ for the same NVMe Transport connection. For example, if an iWARP\nNVMe Transport is used with IPsec as the fabric secure channel technology, the IPsec identities for\nauthentication are associated with the IP network (e.g., DNS host name or IP address), whereas NVMe in-\nband authentication uses NVMe identities (i.e., Host NQNs). The NVMe Transport binding specification\nmay provide further guidance and requirements on the relationship between these two identities, but\ndetermination of which NVMe Transport identities are authorized to be used with which NVMe identities is\npart of the security policy for the deployed NVM subsystem.",
