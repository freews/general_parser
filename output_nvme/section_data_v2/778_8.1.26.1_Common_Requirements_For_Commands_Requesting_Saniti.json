    "text": "Requirements and behaviors that are common for commands requesting sanitize operations (i.e., Sanitize\ncommands (refer to section 5.2.22) and Sanitize Namespace commands (refer to section 5.2.23)) are\ndescribed in this section.\nThe Sanitize command (refer to section 5.2.22) and the Sanitize Namespace command (refer to section\n5.2.23) are used to start a sanitize operation, to recover from a previously failed sanitize operation, or to\nexit the Media Verification state.\nAll sanitize operations (i.e., Block Erase, Crypto Erase, and Overwrite) are performed in the background\n(i.e., completion of the command that starts a sanitize operation does not indicate completion of that sanitize\noperation). The completion of a sanitize operation, which may include an optional transition into the Media\nVerification state, is indicated in the Sanitize Status log page, and with:\n•\nthe Sanitize Operation Completed asynchronous event with the Event Specific Parameter field:\no\ncleared to 0h if the sanitization target is the NVM subsystem; or\no\nset to the NSID of the sanitization target if the sanitization target is a namespace;\n•\nthe Sanitize Operation Completed With Unexpected Deallocation asynchronous event with the\nNSID field cleared to 0h; or\n•\nthe Sanitize Operation Entered Media Verification State asynchronous event with the Event\nSpecific Parameter field:\no\ncleared to 0h if the sanitization target is the NVM subsystem; or\no\nset to the NSID of the sanitization target if the sanitization target is a namespace.\nIf the command that started a sanitize operation was submitted to a controller’s Admin Submission Queue,\nthen the asynchronous event shall be reported only by that controller. If the command that started a sanitize\noperation was submitted to a Management Endpoint (refer to the NVM Express Management Interface\nSpecification), then the asynchronous event shall not be reported by any controller in the NVM subsystem.\nIf a sanitize operation starts as a result of a command, then the controller shall complete the command that\nrequested the sanitize operation with a status code of Successful Completion. If the controller completes a\ncommand that requested a sanitize operation with any status code other than Successful Completion, then\nthe controller:\n•\nshall not start the sanitize operation for that command;\n•\nshall not modify the Sanitize Status log page for the sanitization target; and\n•\nshall not alter any user data.\nIf the NVM subsystem supports multiple domains and a command requesting a sanitize operation is not\nable to start a sanitize operation as a result of the NVM subsystem being divided (refer to section 3.2.5),\nthen the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Asymmetric Access Inaccessible or\nAsymmetric Access Persistent Loss.\nIf a command requesting a sanitize operation specifies an unsupported value in the SANACT field (refer to\nFigure 388 and Figure 391), then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field\nin Command.\nIf a firmware activation with reset is pending (refer to section 5.2.8.1 and section 3.11), then the controller\nshall abort the command requesting a sanitize operation as specified in section 5.2.8.1 and section 3.11.\nIf the Firmware Commit command that established the pending firmware activation with reset condition\nreturned a status code of:\na) Firmware Activation Requires Controller Level Reset;\nb) Firmware Activation Requires Conventional Reset; or\nc) Firmware Activation Requires NVM Subsystem Reset,\nthen the controller shall abort the command that requested the sanitize operation with that same status\ncode.\nIf the Firmware Commit command that established the pending firmware activation with reset condition\ncompleted successfully or returned a status code other than:\na) Firmware Activation Requires Controller Level Reset;\nb) Firmware Activation Requires Conventional Reset; or\nc) Firmware Activation Requires NVM Subsystem Reset,\nthen the controller shall abort the command that requested the sanitize operation with a status code of\nFirmware Activation Requires Controller Level Reset.\nActivation of new firmware is prohibited during a sanitize operation (refer to section 8.1.26.5).\nIf a change to the settings of any personality is pending (refer to section 8.1.6.1), then the controller shall\nabort the Sanitize command with a status code of Access Denied.\nAfter validating the command parameters, the controller starts the sanitize operation in the background,\nupdates the Sanitize Status log page for the sanitization target and then completes the command that\nrequested the sanitize operation with Successful Completion status.\nThe controller shall ignore Critical Warning(s) in the SMART / Health Information log page (e.g., read only\nmode) and shall attempt to complete the sanitize operation requested. Refer to section 5 for further\ninformation about restrictions on Admin commands during the processing of a command requesting a\nsanitize operation.",
