All controllers in an NVM subsystem\nshall support the same controller model.\nIn an NVM subsystem that supports the static controller model, state (e.g., controller ID, saved Feature\nsettings) is preserved:\n•\nacross a Controller Level Reset for memory-based controllers and message-based controllers; and\n•\nfrom prior associations for message-based controllers.\nIn an NVM subsystem that supports the dynamic controller model, the NVM subsystem allocates controllers\non demand with no state preserved from prior associations.",
