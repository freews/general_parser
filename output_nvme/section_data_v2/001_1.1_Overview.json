This interface is optimized for all storage solutions, attached using a variety of transports\nincluding PCI Express®, Ethernet, InfiniBandTM, and Fibre Channel. The mapping of extensions defined in\nthis document to a specific NVMe Transport are defined in an NVMe Transport binding specification. The\nNVMe Transport binding specification for Fibre Channel is defined in INCITS 556 Fibre Channel – Non-\nVolatile Memory Express - 2 (FC-NVMe-2).\nFor an overview of changes from revision 2.2 to revision 2.3 and the description of the new features,\nincluding mandatory requirements for a controller to comply with revision 2.3, refer to\nhttps://nvmexpress.org/specification/nvm-express-revision-changes.",
