For example, the controller is not responsible for checking the LBA of an NVM\nCommand Set Read command or Write command to ensure any type of ordering between commands. If a\nRead command is submitted for LBA x and there is a Write command also submitted for LBA x, there is no\nguarantee of the order of completion for those commands (the Read command may finish first or the Write\ncommand may finish first). If there are ordering requirements between these commands, a host or the\nassociated application is required to enforce that ordering above the level of the controller.",
