If this bit is cleared to '0', then the restriction on data and metadata use of Controller Memory Buffer by a command as defined in section 8.2.1 is enforced. |\n| RO | Impl Spec | **CMB Data Pointer and Command Independent Locations Support (CDPCILS):** If this bit is set to '1', then the restriction that the PRP Lists and SGLs shall not be located in the Controller Memory Buffer if the command that they are associated with is not located in the Controller Memory Buffer is not enforced (refer to section 8.2.1).
