    "text": "The Host Identifier is an optional feature when implemented on a controller using a PCIe transport. The\ncontroller may support a 64-bit Host Identifier and/or an extended 128-bit Host Identifier. It is recommended\nthat implementations support the extended 128-bit Host Identifier as indicated in the Controller Attributes\nfield in the Identify Controller data structure.\nThe Host Identifier for PCIe transport implementations shall have a default value of 0h and shall not have\na saved value. NVM Express Base Specification, Revision 2.0 and earlier allowed saving a Host Identifier\nvalue, if a non-zero Host Identifier value had been saved then that saved value shall be reset to the default\nvalue.",
