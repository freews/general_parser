    "text": "The Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB) provides a means for the system to store data to a specific\nmemory area in an authenticated and replay protected manner. This is provided by first programming\nauthentication key information to the controller that is used as a shared secret. The system is not\nauthenticated in this phase, therefore the authentication key programming should be done in a secure\nenvironment (e.g., as part of the manufacturing process). The authentication key is utilized to sign the read\nand write accesses made to the replay protected memory area with a Message Authentication Code (MAC).\nUse of random number (nonce) generation and a write count property provide additional protection against\nreplay of messages where messages could be recorded and played back later by an attacker.\nAny attempt to access the replay protected memory area prior to the Authentication Key being programmed\nresults in an RPMB Operation Result Operation Status field set to 07h (i.e., Authentication Key not yet\nprogrammed) (refer to Figure 692). Once the key is programmed, the RPMB Operation Result Operation\nStatus field shall not be set to 07h.\nAn Authenticated Data Write to the RPMB Device Configuration Block data structure that attempts to set\nthe Boot Partition Write Protection Enabled bit when RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection is not supported\nresults in an RPMB Operation Result Operation Status of 05h (i.e., Write failure in the RPMB Operation\nStatus field) (refer to Figure 692).\nAn Authenticated Data Write to the RPMB Device Configuration Block data structure that attempts to set\nthe Boot Partition Write Protection Enabled bit when either Boot Partition is in the Write Locked Until Power\nCycle state (refer to section 5.2.26.1.36 and section 8.1.3.3.1) results in an RPMB Operation Result\nOperation Status of 05h (i.e., Write failure in the RPMB Operation Status field) (refer to Figure 692).\nAn Authenticated Data Write to the RPMB Device Configuration Block data structure that attempts to\nchange either the Boot Partition 0 Write Locked bit or the Boot Partition 1 Write Locked bit when the Boot\nPartition Write Protection Enabled bit is cleared to ‘0’ results in an RPMB Operation Result Operation Status\nfield set to 05h (i.e., Write failure) (refer to Figure 692).\nIf Set Features Boot Partition Write Protection is supported, then an Authenticated Data Write to the RPMB\nDevice Configuration Block data structure that successfully enables RPMB Boot Partition Write Protection\nshall also result in the controller changing the Boot Partition 0 Write Protection State and Boot Partition 1\nWrite Protection State values in the Boot Partition Write Protection Config feature to a value of 100b to\nindicate that Boot Partition write protection is controlled by RPMB.\nThe controller may support multiple RPMB targets. RPMB targets are not contained within a namespace.\nControllers in the NVM subsystem may share the same RPMB targets. Security Send and Security Receive\ncommands for RPMB do not use the namespace ID field; NSID shall be cleared to 0h. Each RPMB target\noperates independently – there may be requests outstanding to multiple RPMB targets at once (where the\nrequests may be interleaved between RPMB targets). In order to guarantee ordering the host should issue\nand wait for completion for one Security Send or Security Receive command at a time. Each RPMB target\nrequires individual authentication and key programming. Each RPMB target may have its own unique\nAuthentication Key.\nThe message types defined in Figure 691 are used by the host to communicate with an RPMB target.\nRequest Message Types are sent from the host to the controller using Security Send commands. Response\nMessage Types are retrieved by the host from the controller using Security Receive commands.\nFigure 690 defines the RPMB Device Configuration Block data structure – the non-volatile contents stored\nwithin the controller for RPMB target 0.\nThe operation result defined in Figure 692 indicates whether an RPMB request was successful or not.\nEach RPMB Data Frame is 256 bytes in size plus the size of the Data field, and is organized as shown in\nFigure 694. RPMB uses a sector size of 512 bytes. The RPMB sector size is independent and not related\nto the user data size used for the namespace(s).\nSecurity Send and Security Receive commands are used to encapsulate and deliver data packets of any\nsecurity protocol between the host and controller without interpreting, dis-assembling or re-assembling the\ndata packets for delivery. Security Send and Security Receive commands used for RPMB access are\npopulated with the RPMB Data Frame(s) defined in Figure 694. The controller shall not return successful\ncompletion of a Security Send or Security Receive command for RPMB access until the requested RPMB\nRequest/Response Message Type indicated is completed. The Security Protocol used for RPMB is defined\nin section 5.2.24.3.",
