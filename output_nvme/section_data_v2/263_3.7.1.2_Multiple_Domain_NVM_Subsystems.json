    "text": "The scope of an NVM Subsystem Reset depends on whether the NVM subsystem supports multiple\ndomains. In an NVM subsystem that supports multiple domains, the scope of the NVM Subsystem Reset\nis either the controllers that are in a domain or the entire NVM subsystem.\nAn NVM Subsystem Reset on a domain is initiated when:\n•\nPower is applied to that domain;\n•\nA value of 4E564D65h (i.e., “NVMe”) is written to the NSSR.NSSRC field of one of the controllers\nin that domain; or\n•\nA vendor specific event occurs within that domain.\nWhen an NVM Subsystem Reset occurs the entire domain is reset. This includes the initiation of a Controller\nLevel Reset on all controllers that are in the domain, disabling of the Persistent Memory Region associated\nwith all controllers that are in the domain, and any transport specific actions defined in the applicable NVM\nExpress Transport specification.\nAlternatively, an NVM Subsystem Reset in an NVM subsystem that supports multiple domains may reset\nthe entire NVM subsystem.\nThe occurrence of an NVM Subsystem Reset while power is applied to the domain is reported by the initial\nvalue of the CSTS.NSSRO field following the NVM Subsystem Reset. This field may be used by a host to\ndetermine if the sudden loss of communication with a controller was due to an NVM Subsystem Reset or\nsome other condition.\nThe ability for a host to initiate an NVM Subsystem Reset by writing to the NSSR.NSSRC field is an optional\ncapability of a controller indicated by the state of the CAP.NSSRS field. An implementation may protect the\ndomain from an inadvertent NVM Subsystem Reset by not providing this capability to one or more\ncontrollers that are in the domain.",
