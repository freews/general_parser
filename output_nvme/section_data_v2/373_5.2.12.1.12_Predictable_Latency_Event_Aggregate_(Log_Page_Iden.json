    "text": "This log page indicates if a Predictable Latency Event (refer to section 8.1.19.1) has occurred for a particular\nNVM Set. If a Predictable Latency Event has occurred, the details of the particular event are included in the\nPredictable Latency Per NVM Set log page for that NVM Set. An asynchronous event is generated when\nan entry for an NVM Set is newly added to this log page.\nThis log page shall not contain an entry (i.e., an NVM Set Identifier) that is cleared to 0h.\nIf there is an enabled Predictable Latency Event pending for an NVM Set, then the Predictable Latency\nEvent Aggregate log page includes an entry for that NVM Set. The log page is an ordered list by NVM Set\nIdentifier. For example, if Predictable Latency Events are pending for NVM Set 27, 13, and 17, then the log\npage shall have entries in numerical order of 13, 17, and 27. A particular NVM Set is removed from this log\npage after the Get Log Page command with the Retain Asynchronous Event bit cleared to ‘0’ for the\nPredictable Latency Per NVM Set log page for that NVM Set is completed successfully.\nThe log page size is limited by the NVM Set Identifier Maximum value reported in the Identify Controller\ndata structure (refer to Figure 328). The log page is defined in Figure 225. If the number of dwords\nrequested to be returned by the Get Log Page command (refer to section 5.2.12) includes data beyond the\nend of the Predictable Latency Event Aggregate log page (refer to Figure 225), then zeros shall be returned\nfor data transferred beyond the end of that log page.",
