    "text": "This functionality allows the host to specify the temperature hysteresis that a controller shall use to\ndetermine the end of a temperature threshold event.\nIf the controller supports the use of the Temperature Threshold Hysteresis feature as indicated by at non-\nzero value of the TMPTHMH field (refer to Figure 328), then the controller shall:\n•\nsupport this feature for the Composite Temperature value (refer to Figure 407); and\n•\nsupport the Temperature Threshold Hysteresis Recovery event (refer to Figure 328).\nIf hysteresis is supported for Threshold Temperature Select values other than Composite Temperature (i.e.,\n0h) (refer to Figure 407); then, associated with each implemented temperature sensor is an over-\ntemperature threshold and an under-temperature threshold with a hysteresis value. If the host specifies\nhysteresis for a Threshold Temperature Select that is not supported, the controller shall abort the command\nwith a status of Invalid Field in Command.\nAn over-temperature threshold hysteresis event begins when the value of a temperature field (refer to the\ntemperature values reported as described in section 5.2.26.1.3) transitions from less than its corresponding\ntemperature threshold to greater than or equal to that temperature threshold. That over-temperature\nthreshold hysteresis event ends when the value of that temperature field transitions from greater than or\nequal to that temperature threshold to less than that temperature threshold minus the value of the\nTemperature Threshold Hysteresis (TMPTHH) field.\nAn under-temperature threshold hysteresis event begins when the value of a temperature field transitions\nfrom greater than its corresponding temperature threshold to less than or equal to that temperature\nthreshold. That under-temperature threshold hysteresis event ends when the value of that temperature field\ntransitions from less than or equal to that temperature threshold to greater than that temperature threshold\nplus the value of the Temperature Threshold Hysteresis (TMPTHH) field.\nWhen a temperature threshold hysteresis event has started, the Temperature Threshold Condition (TTC)\nis set to ‘1’ of the Critical Warning field in the SMART / Health Information log page (refer to section\n5.2.12.1.3) is set to ‘1’. This may trigger an initial asynchronous event.\nAt the end of a temperature threshold hysteresis event, a Temperature Threshold Hysteresis Recovery\nevent shall be triggered (refer to Figure 409), the TTC bit (refer to section 5.2.12.1.3) shall be cleared to ’0’\nand the Warning Composite Temperature Time field shall stop accumulating the number of minutes.\nIf the value of the Temperature Threshold Hysteresis field is larger than the value supported by the controller\nas specified by the TMPTHMH field in Figure 328, the controller shall abort the command with a status code\nof Invalid Field in Command.",
