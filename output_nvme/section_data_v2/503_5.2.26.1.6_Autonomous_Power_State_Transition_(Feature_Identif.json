    "text": "This Feature configures the settings for autonomous controller power state transitions, refer to section\n8.1.18.2.\nThis Feature uses Command Dword 11 to specify the attribute information defined in Figure 410. This\nFeature uses the data buffer that contains the Autonomous Power State Transition data structure consisting\nof 32 of the entries as defined in Figure 411.\nIf a Get Features command is issued for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure 410 are returned in\nDword 0 of the completion queue entry and the Autonomous Power State Transition data structure, as\ndefined in Figure 411, is returned in the data buffer for that command.\nThe Autonomous Power State Transition data structure is defined in Figure 411. There is an entry for each\nof the allowable power states where the contents of each entry is defined in Figure 412. For power states\nthat are not supported, the unused Autonomous Power State Transition data structure entries shall be\ncleared to all zeroes.\nThe Autonomous Power State Transition feature may interact with the Non-Operational Power State Config\nfeature (refer to section 5.2.26.1.10). Figure 413 shows these interactions.",

If the ITPT field is set to a non-zero value, then the state specified in this field shall be a non-operational state as described in Figure 329. This field should not specify a power state with higher reported idle power than the current power state.
