    "text": "A Media Unit represents a component of the underlying media in a domain. An implementation may choose\nto represent each die as a separate Media Unit; however, this is not required. A Media Unit is the smallest\nmedia component for which the controller reports wear information (refer to the Available Spare field and\nthe Percentage Used field in the Media Unit Status Descriptor, Figure 260).\nTwo or more I/O operations to a Media Unit at the same time may interfere with each other as they contend\nfor resources internal to or shared by that Media Unit.\nA controller supporting Fixed Capacity Management:\na) shall support the Media Unit Status log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.16);\nb) shall support Endurance Groups (refer to section 3.2.3);\nc) may support NVM Sets (refer to section 3.2.2);\nd) shall set the Fixed Capacity Management bit to ‘1’ in the CTRATT field of the Identify Controller\ndata structure (refer to Figure 328);\ne) shall support the Supported Capacity Configuration List log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.17); and\nf)\nshall support the Select Capacity Configuration operation of the Capacity Management command\n(refer to section 5.2.3).\nMedia Units are accessed by way of Channels that represent communication pathways that may be a\nsource of contention. This information is reported to facilitate the composition of NVM Sets that minimize\ninterference between independent writers competing for this type of resource.\nThe host allocates the Media Units in a domain to Endurance Groups and NVM Sets by:\n1) reading the Supported Capacity Configuration List log page (refer to Figure 261) and selecting the\ndesired configuration; and\n2) issuing a Capacity Management command specifying the Select Capacity Configuration operation\nand the Capacity Configuration Identifier of the desired configuration.\nFollowing successful completion of the command, each Media Unit is allocated to one Endurance Group\nand to one NVM Set. The resulting configuration of Media Units is reported by the Media Unit Status log\npage (refer to section 5.2.12.1.16).",
