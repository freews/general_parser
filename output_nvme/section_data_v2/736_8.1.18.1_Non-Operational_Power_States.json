    "text": "A power state may be a non-operational power state, as indicated by Non-Operational State (NOPS) field\nin Figure 329. Non-operational power states allow the following operations:\n•\nproperty accesses;\n•\nPMR accesses, if any;\n•\nCMB accesses, if any;\n•\nprocessing of Admin commands and processing background operations, if any, initiated by that\ncommand (e.g., Device Self-test command (refer to section 5.2.5), Sanitize command (refer to\nsection 5.2.22)); and\n•\nadditional transport-specific accesses as defined in the applicable NVMe Transport binding\nspecification.\nFor the operations listed in the preceding paragraph, the controller:\n•\nmay exceed the power advertised by the non-operational power state;\n•\nshall logically remain in the current non-operational power state unless an I/O command is received\nor if an explicit transition is requested by a Set Features command with the Power Management\nFeature Identifier; and\n•\nshall not exceed the maximum power advertised for the most recent operational power state.\nHMB non-operational power state access restriction (refer to section 5.2.26.2.4) does not prohibit the\ncontroller from accessing the HMB while processing Admin commands and while performing host-initiated\nbackground operations initiated by Admin commands. HMB non-operational power state access restriction\ndoes prohibit the controller from accessing the HMB in order to perform controller-initiated activity (i.e.,\nactivity not directly associated with a command).\nExecution of controller-initiated background operations may exceed the power advertised by the non-\noperational power state, if the Non-Operational Power State Permissive Mode is supported and enabled\n(refer to section 5.2.26.1.10).\nNo I/O commands are processed by the controller while in a non-operational power state. The host should\nwait until there are no pending I/O commands prior to issuing a Set Features command to change the\ncurrent power state of the device to a non-operational power state and not submit new I/O commands until\nthe Set Features command completes. Issuing an I/O command in parallel may result in the controller being\nin an unexpected power state.\nWhen in a non-operational power state, regardless of whether autonomous power state transitions are\nenabled, the controller shall autonomously transition back to the most recent operational power state to\nprocess an I/O command.",
