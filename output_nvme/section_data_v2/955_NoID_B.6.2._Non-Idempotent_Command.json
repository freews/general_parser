    "text": "In the example shown in Figure 818, the host loses communication with Controller 1 and does not receive\na response from Controller 1 for a Namespace Management command that creates a namespace (refer to\nsection 5.2.21). The host ensures that no further controller processing of that command is possible (refer\nto section 9.6.2), and then retries that command on Controller 2, which creates a second namespace.\nThis example shows why higher-level software (e.g., an associated application, filesystem or database)\nshould take steps to determine that a retry of a non-idempotent command does not cause unintended\nchanges to NVM subsystem state (e.g., number of namespaces).",
