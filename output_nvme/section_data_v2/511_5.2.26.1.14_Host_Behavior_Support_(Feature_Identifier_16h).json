    "text": "This Feature enables use of controller functionality that is associated with and depends upon specific host\nbehavior that may or may not be supported by all hosts. A controller does not use such functionality unless\nthe host has indicated that the host supports the specific host behavior upon which the functionality\ndepends. The host indicates that support to the controller by setting a field in this Feature. That host action\nenables controller use of the associated functionality with that host. A controller shall not use functionality\nwith a host that has not indicated support for the associated specific host behavior upon which that controller\nfunctionality depends. The attributes in Figure 426 are transferred in the data buffer.\nFor example, the Command Interrupted status code is associated with and depends upon the specific host\nbehavior that the host is expected to retry commands that are aborted with that status code. That command\nretry behavior may or may not be supported by all hosts (e.g., hosts compliant with versions 1.3 and earlier\nof the NVM Express Base Specification are unlikely to retry commands aborted with the Command\nInterrupted status code as that status code was introduced after NVM Express Base Specification, Revision\n1.3). A host that supports that command retry behavior indicates its support to the controller by setting a\nfield to 1h in the Host Behavior Support Feature. Setting that field to 1h enables controller use of the\nCommand Interrupted status code, with the result that this status code is used only with hosts that have\nindicated support for the associated command retry behavior.\nThis Feature is not saveable (refer to Figure 199). The default value of this Feature shall be all bytes cleared\nto 0h.\nAfter a successful completion of a Set Features command for this Feature, the controller may use controller-\nto-host functionality that depends on specific host behavior as indicated by the attributes. If multiple Set\nFeatures commands for this Feature are processed by the controller, only information from the most recent\nsuccessful command is retained (i.e., subsequent commands replace information provided by previous\ncommands).\nIf a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure 426 are returned\nin the data buffer for that command.",
