    "text": "A Scatter Gather List (SGL) is a data structure in memory address space used to describe a data buffer.\nThe controller indicates the SGL types that the controller supports in the Identify Controller data structure.\nA data buffer is either a source buffer or a destination buffer. An SGL contains one or more SGL segments.\nThe SGL length is the combined total of the values in the Length fields in the SGL Data Block, SGL Bit\nBucket, Keyed SGL Data Block, and Transport SGL Data Block descriptors in an SGL. The SGL length\nshall be equal to or exceed the requested data transfer length.\nThe requested data transfer length is either defined in the specification of a command (e.g., the requested\ndata transfer length for the Reservation Acquire command is 16 bytes); or is determined based on values\nin one or more command specific locations in the SQE (e.g., the requested data transfer length is specified\nin the NLB field for a Write command (refer to the NVM Express NVM Command Set Specification) and is\nspecified in the NUMDL field and the NUMDU field for a Get Log Page command (refer to section 5.2.12)).\nIf the requested data transfer length exceeds the SGL length, then:\n•\ndata shall not be transferred to or from locations that are not described by the SGL;\n•\nif that SGL is a data SGL, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Data\nSGL Length Invalid; and\n•\nif that SGL is a metadata SGL, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of\nMetadata SGL Length Invalid.\nAn SGL segment is a qword aligned data structure in a contiguous region of physical memory describing\nall, part of, or none of a data buffer and the next SGL segment, if any. An SGL segment consists of an array\nof one or more SGL descriptors. Only the last descriptor in an SGL segment may be an SGL Segment\ndescriptor or an SGL Last Segment descriptor.\nA last SGL segment is an SGL segment that does not contain an SGL Segment descriptor, or an SGL Last\nSegment descriptor.\nA controller may support byte or dword alignment and granularity of Data Blocks. If a controller supports\nonly dword alignment and granularity as indicated in the SGL Support field of the Identify Controller data\nstructure (refer to Figure 328), then the values in the Address and Length fields of all Data Block descriptors\nshall have their two least significant bits cleared to 00b. This requirement applies to Data Block descriptors\nthat indicate data and/or metadata memory regions.\nThe SGL Descriptor Threshold (SDT) field in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328)\nindicates the recommended maximum number of SGL descriptors for a command. If the SDT field is set to\na non-zero value, and a command is submitted for which the sum of:\na) the number of SGL Bit Bucket descriptors with non-zero Length field contents; and\nb) the number of SGL Data Block descriptors with a non-zero Length field contents,\nexceeds the value of the SDT field, then the performance of the controller may be reduced.\nThe value of the SDT field shall be less than or equal to the value of the Maximum SGL Data Block\nDescriptors (MSDBD) field in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328 for the definition of\nthe MSDBD field).\nA Keyed SGL Data Block descriptor is a Data Block descriptor that includes a key that is used as part of\nthe host memory access. The maximum length that may be specified in a Keyed SGL Data Block descriptor\nis (16 MiB – 1).\nA Transport SGL Data Block descriptor is a Data Block descriptor that specifies a data block that is\ntransferred by the NVMe Transport using a transfer mechanism and data buffers that are specific to the\nNVMe Transport.\nThe SGL Identifier Descriptor Sub Type field may indicate additional information about a descriptor. As an\nexample, the Sub Type may indicate that the Address field is an offset rather than an absolute address.\nThe Sub Type may also indicate NVMe Transport specific information.\nThe controller shall examine an SGL descriptor for errors before using that SGL descriptor for data transfer.\nSGL descriptor error checking may occur in any order and data may be transferred using a valid SGL\ndescriptor before an SGL descriptor error is detected in another SGL descriptor. The controller is not\nrequired to examine for errors any SGL descriptor that is not used for data transfer.\nIf the LLDTS bit is cleared to ‘0’ and the length of an SGL is greater than the requested data transfer length,\nthen:\n•\nthe controller should not abort the command for this reason; and\n•\nif the controller does abort the command for this reason, then the controller should abort the\ncommand with a status code of:\no\nData SGL Length Invalid if that SGL is a data SGL; and\no\nMetadata SGL Length Invalid if that SGL is a metadata SGL.\nFor all SGL descriptors examined for errors by the controller:\n•\nIf the controller detects an error condition listed in Figure 113, then the controller shall abort the\ncommand with the corresponding status code listed in that figure; and\n•\nIf:\no\nan SGL Data Block descriptor, Keyed SGL Data Block descriptor, or a Transport SGL Data\nBlock descriptor contains Address or Length fields with either of the two least-significant\nbits set to 1b; and\no\nthe controller supports only dword alignment and granularity as indicated in the SGL\nSupport field of the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328),\nthen the controller should abort the command with a status code of SGL Data Block Granularity\nInvalid.\nFigure 114 defines the SGL segment.\nAn SGL segment contains one or more SGL descriptors. Figure 115 defines the generic SGL descriptor\nformat.\nThe SGL Descriptor Type field defined in Figure 116 specifies the SGL descriptor type. If the SGL Descriptor\nType field is set to a reserved value or an unsupported value, then the SGL descriptor shall be processed\nas having an SGL Descriptor Type error. If the SGL Descriptor Sub Type field is set to a reserved value or\nan unsupported value, then the descriptor shall be processed as having an SGL Descriptor Type error.\nAn SGL descriptor set to all zeroes is an SGL Data Block descriptor with the Address field cleared to 0h\nand the Length field cleared to 0h may be used as a NULL descriptor.\nFigure 117 defines the SGL Descriptor Sub Type values and indicates the SGL Descriptor Types to which\neach SGL Descriptor Sub Type applies.\nThe SGL Data Block descriptor, defined in Figure 118, describes a data block.\nThe SGL Bit Bucket descriptor, defined in Figure 119, is used to ignore parts of source data.\nThe SGL Segment descriptor, defined in Figure 120, describes the next SGL segment, which is not the last\nSGL segment.\nThe SGL Last Segment descriptor, defined in Figure 121, describes the next and last SGL segment. A last\nSGL segment that contains an SGL Segment descriptor or an SGL Last Segment descriptor is processed\nas an error.\nThe Keyed SGL Data Block descriptor, defined in Figure 122, describes a keyed data block.",
