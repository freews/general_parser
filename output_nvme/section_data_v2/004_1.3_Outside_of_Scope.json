    "text": "The property interface and command set are specified apart from any usage model for the NVM, but rather\nonly specifies the communication interface to the NVM subsystem. Thus, this specification does not specify\nwhether the NVM subsystem is used as a solid-state drive, a main memory, a cache memory, a backup\nmemory, a redundant memory, etc. Specific usage models are outside the scope, optional, and not\nlicensed.\nThis specification defines requirements and behaviors that are implementation agnostic. The\nimplementation of these requirements and behaviors are outside the scope of this specification. For\nexample, an NVM subsystem that follows this specification may be implemented by an SSD that attaches\ndirectly to a fabric, a device that translates between a fabric and a PCIe NVMe SSD, or software running\non a general-purpose server.\nThis interface is specified above any non-volatile media management, like wear leveling. Erases and other\nmanagement tasks for NVM technologies like NAND are abstracted.\nThis specification does not contain any information on caching algorithms or techniques.\nThe implementation or use of other published specifications referred to in this specification, even if required\nfor compliance with the specification, are outside the scope of this specification (e.g., PCI, PCI Express,\nand PCI-X). This includes published specifications for fabrics and other technologies referred to by this\ndocument or any NVMe Transport binding specification.",
