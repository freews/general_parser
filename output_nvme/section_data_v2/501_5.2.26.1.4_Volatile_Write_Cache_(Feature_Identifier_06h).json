    "text": "This Feature controls the volatile write cache, if present, on the controller. If a volatile write cache is present\n(refer to the VWC field in Figure 328), then this Feature shall be supported. The attributes are specified in\nCommand Dword 11.\nNote: If the controller is able to guarantee that data present in a write cache is written to non-volatile storage\nmedia on loss of power, then that write cache is considered non-volatile and this Feature does not apply to\nthat write cache.\nIf a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure 408 are returned\nin Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.\nIf a volatile write cache is not present, then a Set Features command specifying the Volatile Write Cache\nfeature identifier shall abort with a status code of Invalid Field in Command, and a Get Features command\nspecifying the Volatile Write Cache feature identifier shall abort with a status code of Invalid Field in\nCommand.\nIf a volatile write cache is present and the volatile write cache is disabled (i.e., the WCE bit is cleared to\n‘0’), then the user data written by any command to a namespace shall be persistent. Refer to the Volatile\nWrite Cache Presence field contained in the Common Namespace Features field in Figure 335.",
