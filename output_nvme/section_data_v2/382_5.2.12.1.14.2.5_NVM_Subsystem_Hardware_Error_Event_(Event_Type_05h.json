Which of the NVM subsystem hardware error events\nare supported is vendor specific. The NVM subsystem hardware error event shall set the Persistent Event\nLog Event Header:\n•\nEvent Type field to 05h; and\n•\nEvent Type Revision Field to 02h.\nAll detected NVM Subsystem Hardware Error events supported by the NVM subsystem shall be logged\nunless otherwise specified (e.g., suppressed due to reoccurrence frequency (refer to section 5.2.12.1.14)).\nNVM Subsystem Hardware Error event fields reporting information that is not available (e.g., due to a PCIe\noptional feature that is not implemented) shall be cleared to 0h unless otherwise specified in the NVM\nSubsystem Hardware Error Event code description.\nThe NVM Subsystem Hardware Error Event data is specified in Figure 239.",

or |\n| | • the Controller Ready Independent of Media Timeout (CRTO.CRIMT) field in Controller Ready Independent of Media mode (CC.CRIME is set to '1'), |\n| | since the controller was enabled; or |\n| | b) at least one namespace attached to the controller or media required to process at least one Admin command was not ready within the amount of time indicated by the Controller Ready With Media Timeout (CRTO.CRWMT) field since the controller was enabled by transitioning CC.EN from '0' to '1'. |\n| | Refer to Figure 243 for the format of the Additional Hardware Error Information field. |\n| FFh | Reserved |\n| | Power Losses field in the SMART / Health Information log page at the time of the event. |\n| | **Unexpected Power Loss Information (UPLI):** This field contains additional information about the unexpected power loss. |\n| Bits | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 7:1 | Reserved |\n| 0 | **Unexpected Power Loss Due to Out-Of-Band Activity (UPLOA):** If the shutdown was unsafe because media was not in a shutdown state when main power was lost or because an Admin command that accesses media as defined by Figure 84 was processed via the out-of-band mechanism with the Ignore Shutdown bit set to '1' (refer to the NVM Express Management Interface Specification) while shutdown processing was reported as in progress or was reported as complete (i.e., while the value of the CSTS.SHST field was set to 01b or 10b), then this bit shall be set to '1'; otherwise, this bit shall be cleared to '0'. |\n| | **42: Additional Hardware Error Information for correctable and uncorrectable PCIe errors** |\n| Description | |\n| PCle Device Status Register (PCIEDSR): Contains the contents of the PCI Device Status Register (refer to the PCI Express Base Specification) at the time of the event. | |\n| Bits | Description |\n|:---|:---|\n| 7:4 | Reserved |\n| 3 | **Controller Not Ready (CNR)**: Indicates the controller was not ready to process at least one command without error as described in section 3.5.4.1 within the amount of time indicated by:<br>a) the Controller Ready With Media Timeout (CRTO.CRWMT) field in Controller Ready With Media mode (CC.CRIME is cleared to '0'); or<br>b) the Controller Ready Independent of Media Timeout (CRTO.CRIMT) field in Controller Ready Independent of Media mode (CC.CRIME is set to '1'), since the controller was enabled. |\n| 2 | **Admin Command Media Not Ready (ACMNR)**: Indicates media required to process at least one Admin command was not ready within the amount of time indicated by the Controller Ready With Media Timeout (CRTO.CRWMT) field since the controller was enabled by transitioning CC.EN from '0' to '1'. |\n| 1 | **Namespace Not Ready (NNR)**: Indicates at least one namespace attached to the controller was not ready within the amount of time indicated by the Controller Ready With Media Timeout (CRTO.CRWMT) field since the controller was enabled by transitioning CC.EN from '0' to '1'. |\n| 0 | **Controller Ready Independent of Media Enable (CRIME)**: Indicates the value of the CC.CRIME bit when the Controller Ready Timeout Exceeded error occurred. |\n| | Reserved |"
