The identifier (refer to section 4.5) is used to determine when multiple paths to the same namespace or a dispersed namespace are available. For dispersed namespaces, globally unique namespace IDs (refer to section 8.1.10.2) are used to determine when multiple paths are available to the same namespace, as described in section 8.1.10.5. The host examines the ANA log page (refer to section 8.1.13) for each controller to determine the ANA state of each group of namespaces attached to that controller. |"
