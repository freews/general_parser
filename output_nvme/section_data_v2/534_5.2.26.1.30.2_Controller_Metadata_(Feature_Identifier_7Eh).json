    "text": "This Feature is used to store controller metadata about the host platform for later retrieval.\nThe Controller Metadata Feature provides backward compatibility with Management Controllers (refer to\nthe NVM Express Management Interface Specification) compliant with version 1.1 and earlier versions of\nthe NVM Express Management Interface Specification.\nIf a controller supports both the Enhanced Controller Metadata Feature and the Controller Metadata\nFeature, then the Controller Metadata Feature should not be used by the host.\nThe metadata element types defined in Figure 463 are used by this Feature.\nRefer to section 5.2.26.1.30 for the definitions of Command Dword 11 and the Host Metadata data structure.\nIf a Set Features command’s Element Action field of Command Dword 11 is set to 10b (Add Entry Multiple),\nthen the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command and shall not\nchange the Host Metadata Feature value.\nThe default value for the Number of Metadata Element Descriptors of the Controller Metadata Feature shall\nbe 0h on a Controller Level Reset.\nIf a Get Features command with the SEL field set to 011b (i.e., Supported Capabilities) with the Controller\nMetadata Feature value is submitted, then the NS Specific bit in Dword 0 of the corresponding completion\nqueue entry shall be cleared to ‘0’.",
