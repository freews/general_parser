If any of these four bits is set to\n‘1’, then that command is not an Unrestricted Retry command.\nA host may retry any outstanding command that is an Unrestricted Retry command immediately after\ncommunication loss without determining whether further controller processing of that outstanding command\nis possible.\nFor recovery purposes, a host may treat any outstanding command that is an Unrestricted Retry command\nas if that command were a Delayed Retry command or a State-Dependent Retry command.",
