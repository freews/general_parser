    "text": "If the host loses communication with a controller, then the host is unable to receive a completion (CQE) for\nany outstanding command (refer to section 3.4.5) that has been submitted to that controller. If the host is\nable to use another controller to access the same NVM subsystem or re-establish communication with the\noriginal controller, the host may be able to use that controller to recover from the communication loss by\nretrying outstanding commands. It is strongly recommended that any host retry of any outstanding\ncommands after communication loss follow the procedures and requirements in this section in order to\navoid possible corruption of user data and unintended changes to NVM subsystem state (e.g., Reservation\nstate (refer to section 8.1.24)).\nFor command retry purposes, every outstanding command falls into one of three command retry categories,\nUnrestricted Retry, Delayed Retry, or State-Dependent Retry, based on whether the command is\nidempotent (refer to section 9.6.3.1), and whether the command modifies user data or NVM subsystem\nstate. Section 9.6.3.2 defines these categories and describes requirements and restrictions on retrying\noutstanding commands in each category.",
