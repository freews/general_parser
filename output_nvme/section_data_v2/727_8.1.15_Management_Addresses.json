    "text": "Various entities on a network are able to request a management agent to perform management operations\non NVM subsystems. A controller in an NVM subsystem use the Management Addresses capability to\nindicate the network addresses of those management agents. When an NVM subsystem is provisioned in\na storage system, the management addresses are established in the controller.\nManagement agents are able to be located in various networked entities, including:\n•\nNVM subsystems;\n•\nFabric interface managers;\n•\nEmbedded management controllers; and\n•\nA host.\nEach management address is represented as a uniform resource indicator (URI; refer to RFC 3986).\nThe address of a management agent contained in an NVM subsystem (e.g., an Ethernet-attached SSD) is\nindicated in the Management Address List log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.24), in a Management Address\nDescriptor indicating a Management Address Type of 1h. The method by which the address is determined\nis outside the scope of this specification.\nThe address of a management agent contained in a fabric interface manager is indicated in the\nManagement Address List log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.24), in a Management Address Descriptor\nindicating a Management Address Type of 2h. The method by which the address is determined is outside\nthe scope of this specification.\nThe address of a management agent contained in an embedded management controller (e.g., a BMC) is\nset and retrieved using the Embedded Management Controller Address feature (refer to section\n5.2.26.1.24). The Embedded Management Controller Address feature is intended to be set only by the\nstorage system containing the embedded management controller. The embedded management controller\nis able to ensure this by issuing a Lockdown command (refer to section 5.2.15) with the OFI field specifying\nthis Feature, and the PRHBT bit set to ‘1’ and the IFC field set to Admin Submission Queue (i.e., 00b).\nThe address of a management agent contained in the host is set and retrieved using the Host Management\nController Address feature (refer to section 5.2.26.1.29). The Host Management Agent Address feature is\nintended to be set only by the host. The host is able to ensure this by issuing a Lockdown command (refer\nto section 5.2.15) with the OFI field specifying this Feature, and the PRHBT bit set to ‘1’ and the IFC field\nset to Out-of-band on a Management Endpoint (i.e., 10b).",
