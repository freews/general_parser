If any write command:\na. has the DTYPE field being ignored by the controller (refer to section 8.1.9.4); or\nb. has the DTYPE field not being ignored by the controller and specifies a DTYPE field value\ncleared to 00h,\nthen the Placement Handle value of 0h for the specified namespace is combined with a Reclaim\nGroup selected by the controller to create the Placement Identifier (refer to Figure 289 and Figure\n290) utilized for that write command.\n)\n2.\nIf any write command has the DTYPE field not being ignored by the controller and specifies a\nDTYPE field set to Data Placement (i.e., 02h) and specifies a namespace in which the Data\nPlacement Directive is enabled, then the Placement Identifier specified by the DSPEC field\nspecifies the Reclaim Group Identifier and Placement Handle used for the write command.\nTo reduce write amplification, hosts track the user data written to an entire Reclaim Unit and deallocate that\nuser data by issuing one or more Dataset Management commands specifying the AD bit set to ‘1’ and one\nor more Range fields specifying the LBA ranges that were written to that Reclaim Unit.",
