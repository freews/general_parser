Fabrics commands have an\nOpcode field of 7Fh and are distinguished by the Fabrics Command Type as shown in Figure 574. Fabrics\ncommands are processed regardless of the state of controller enable (CC.EN). The Fabrics command\ncapsule is defined in section 3.3.2.1.1 and the Fabrics response capsule and status is defined in section\n3.3.2.1.2. The common Fabrics Submission Queue entry is shown in Figure 94 and the common Fabrics\nCompletion Queue entry is shown in Figure 99.\nRestrictions on processing commands listed in Figure 574 are defined in the Admin Command Set in\nsection 5 (e.g., while the NVM subsystem is performing a sanitize operation or processing of a Format NVM\ncommand).",
