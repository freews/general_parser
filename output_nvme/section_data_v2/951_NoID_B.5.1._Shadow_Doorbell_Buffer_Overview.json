    "text": "Controllers that support the Doorbell Buffer Config command are typically emulated controllers where this\nfeature is used to enhance the performance of the host running in Virtual Machines. If supported by the\ncontroller, the host may enable Shadow Doorbell buffers by submitting the Doorbell Buffer Config command\n(refer to section 5.3.5).\nAfter the completion of the Doorbell Buffer Config command, the host shall submit commands by updating\nthe appropriate entry in the Shadow Doorbell buffer instead of updating the controller's corresponding\ndoorbell property. If updating an entry in the Shadow Doorbell buffer changes the value from being less\nthan or equal to the value of the corresponding EventIdx buffer entry to being greater than that value, then\nthe host shall also update the controller's corresponding doorbell property to match the value of that entry\nin the Shadow Doorbell buffer. Queue wrap conditions shall be taken into account in all comparisons in this\nparagraph.\nThe controller may read from the Shadow Doorbell buffer and update the EventIdx buffer at any time (e.g.\nbefore the host writes to the controller's doorbell property).",
