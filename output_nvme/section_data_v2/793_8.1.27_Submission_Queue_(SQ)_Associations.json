    "text": "When Predictable Latency Mode is enabled, all I/O commands for namespaces in a given NVM Set have\nthe same quality of service attributes and shall exhibit predictable latencies as described in section 8.1.19.1.\nThe SQ Associations capability provides hints to the controller as to which specific I/O Queues are\nassociated with a given NVM Set. The controller uses this information to further enhance performance when\nPredictable Latency Mode is enabled.\nThe SQ Associations capability is an optional capability. Predictable Latency Mode (refer to section\n8.1.19.1) is not dependent on the use of the SQ Associations capability.\nIf a controller supports SQ Associations, then the controller shall:\n•\nindicate support for the SQ Associations capability in the Controller Attributes (CTRATT) field in\nthe Identify Controller data structure;\n•\nindicate support for NVM Sets in the Controller Attributes (CTRATT) field in the Identify Controller\ndata structure; and\n•\nindicate support for Predictable Latency Mode in the Controller Attributes (CTRATT) field in the\nIdentify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328).\nThe host enables the SQ Associations capability by creating an association between an NVM Set and a\nSubmission Queue at the time the Submission Queue is created (e.g., with a Create I/O Submission Queue\ncommand (refer to section 5.3.2) or a Connect command (refer to section 6.3)).\nFor the SQ Associations capability to yield benefits, the host is required to:\na) create an association between each Submission Queue and some NVM Set; and\nb) only issue I/O commands to Submission Queues that have an association with the NVM Set that\ncontains the namespace associated with the Namespace Identifier specified in that I/O command.\nWhile this capability is enabled, failure to follow the specified operating rules may impact Predictable\nLatency (refer to section 8.1.19.1).",
