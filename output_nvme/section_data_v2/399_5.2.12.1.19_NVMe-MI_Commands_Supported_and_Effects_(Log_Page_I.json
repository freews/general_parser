If this bit is cleared to '0' and the CSP field is non-zero, then the command performs actions that do not impact the whole NVM subsystem. |\n| 4 | Domain Scope (DSCPE): If this bit is set to '1', then the command has Domain scope. If this bit is cleared to '0' and the CSP field is non-zero, then the command does not have Domain scope. |\n| 3 | Endurance Group Scope (EGSCPE): If this bit is set to '1', then the command has Endurance Group scope. If this bit is cleared to '0' and the CSP field is non-zero, then the command does not have Endurance Group scope. |\n| 2 | NVM Set Scope (NSCPE): If this bit is set to '1', then the command has NVM Set scope. If this bit is cleared to '0' and the CSP field is non-zero, then the command does not have NVM Set scope. |\n| 1 | Controller Scope (CSCPE): If this bit is set to '1', then the command has controller scope. If this bit is cleared to '0' and the CSP field is non-zero, then the command does not have controller scope. |\n| 0 | Namespace Scope (NSCPE): If this bit is set to '1', then the command has namespace scope. If this bit is cleared to '0' and the CSP field is non-zero, then the command does not have namespace scope. |\n| | Controller Capability Change (CCC): If this bit is set to '1', then this command may change controller capabilities. If this bit is cleared to '0', then this command does not modify controller capabilities. Controller capability changes include a firmware update that changes the capabilities reported in the CAP property. |\n| | Namespace Inventory Change (NIC): If this bit is set to '1', then this command may change the number of namespaces or capabilities for multiple namespaces. If this bit is cleared to '0', then this command does not modify the number of namespaces or capabilities for multiple namespaces. Namespace inventory changes include adding or removing namespaces. |\n| | Namespace Capability Change (NCC): If this bit is set to '1', then this command may change the capabilities of a single namespace. If this bit is cleared to '0', then this command does not modify any namespace capabilities for the specified namespace. Namespace capability changes include a logical format change. |\n| | User Data Content Change (UDCC): If this bit is set to '1', then this command may modify user data content in one or more namespaces. If this bit is cleared to '0', then this command does not modify user data content in any namespace. User data content changes include a write operation. |\n| | Command Supported (CSUPP): If this bit is set to '1', then this command is supported by the controller. If this bit is cleared to '0', then this command is not supported by the controller and all other fields in this structure shall be cleared to 0h. |"
