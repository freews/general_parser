    "text": "A controller supports one Authentication Method as indicated in the Identify Controller data structure.\nIf the Authentication Method supported is HMAC SHA-256 (refer to RFC 6234), then the message\nauthentication code (MAC) is calculated using HMAC SHA-256 as defined in RFC 6234. The key used to\ngenerate a MAC using HMAC SHA-256 is the 256-bit Authentication Key stored in the controller for the\nselected RPMB target. The HMAC SHA-256 calculation takes as input a key and a message. Input to the\nMAC calculation is the concatenation of the fields in the RPMB Data Frame (request or response) excluding\nstuff bytes and the MAC itself – i.e., bytes [223:255] and Data of the frame in that order.",
