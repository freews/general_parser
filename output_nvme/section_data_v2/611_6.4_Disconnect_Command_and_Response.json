    "text": "The Disconnect command is used to delete the I/O Queue on which the command is submitted. If a\nDisconnect command is submitted on an Admin Queue, then the controller shall abort the command with a\nstatus code of Invalid Queue Type. If the controller is not able to delete the I/O Queue, then the controller\nshall abort the command with a status code of Controller Busy. The fields for the submission queue entry\nare defined in Figure 583.\nThe NVMe Transport connection is not deleted upon issuance of a Disconnect command; the host and\ncontroller may delete the NVMe Transport connection and associated resources after all NVMe Queues\n(I/O Queues and/or Admin Queue) associated with that NVMe Transport connection have been deleted\n(refer to section 3.3.2.4).\nThe completion queue entry for the Disconnect command shall be the last entry submitted to the I/O Queue\nCompletion queue by the controller (i.e., no completion queue entries shall be submitted to the I/O Queue\nCompletion Queue after the completion queue entry for the Disconnect command). The controller shall\nensure that no further command processing is performed for any command on an I/O queue after sending\nthe completion queue entry for the Disconnect command.\nThe host should not submit commands to an I/O Submission Queue after the submission of a Disconnect\ncommand to that I/O Submission Queue; submitting commands to an I/O Queue after a Disconnect\ncommand is submitted to that I/O Queue results in undefined behavior.\nThe Disconnect response provides status for the Disconnect command. The Disconnect response is\ndefined in Figure 584.",
