    "text": "Only a reservation holder is able to release a reservation held on a namespace. A host should release a\nreservation using the following sequence:\na) executing a Reservation Release command (refer to section 7.7);\nb) clearing the Reservation Release Action (RRELA) field to 000b (i.e., Release);\nc) setting the Reservation Type (RTYPE) field to the type of reservation being released; and\nd) supplying the current reservation key associated with the host in the Current Reservation Key\n(CRKEY) field. The CRKEY value shall match that used by the host to register with the namespace.\nIf the key value does not match, then the command is aborted with a status code of Reservation Conflict. If\nthe RTYPE field does not match the type of the current reservation, then the command completes with a\nstatus code of Invalid Field in Command.\nAn attempt by a registrant to release a reservation using the Reservation Release command in the absence\nof a reservation held on the namespace or when the host is not the reservation holder shall cause the\ncommand to complete successfully, but shall have no effect on the controller or namespace.\nWhen a reservation is released as a result of actions described in this section and the reservation type is\nnot Write Exclusive or Exclusive Access, a reservation released notification occurs on all controllers in the\nNVM subsystem that are associated with hosts that are registrants except for controllers that are associated\nwith the host that issued the Reservation Release command.",
