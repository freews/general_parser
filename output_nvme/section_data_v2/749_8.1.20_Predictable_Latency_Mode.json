    "text": "Predictable Latency Mode is used to achieve predictable latency for read and write operations. When\nconfigured to operate in this mode using the Predictable Latency Mode Config Feature (refer to section\n5.2.26.1.12), the namespaces in an NVM Set (refer to section 3.2.2) provide windows of operation for\ndeterministic operation or non-deterministic operation.\nWhen Predictable Latency Mode is enabled:\n•\nNVM Sets and their associated namespaces have vendor specific quality of service attributes;\n•\nI/O commands that access NVM in the same NVM Set have the same quality of service attributes;\nand\n•\nI/O commands that access NVM in one NVM Set do not impact the quality of service of I/O\ncommands that access NVM in a different NVM Set.\nThe quality of service attributes apply within the NVM subsystem and do not include the PCIe or fabric\nconnection. To enhance isolation, the host should submit I/O commands for different NVM Sets to different\nI/O Submission Queues.\nRead Recovery Levels (refer to section 8.1.22) shall be supported when Predictable Latency Mode is\nsupported. The host configures the Read Recovery Level to specify the tradeoff between the quality of\nservice versus the amount of error recovery to apply for a particular NVM Set.\nThe Deterministic Window (DTWIN) is the window of operation during which the NVM Set is able to provide\ndeterministic latency for read and write operations. The Non-Deterministic Window (NDWIN) is the window\nof operation during which the NVM Set is not able to provide deterministic latency for read and write\noperations as a result of preparing for a subsequent Deterministic Window. Examples of actions that may\nbe performed in the Non-Deterministic Window include background operations on the non-volatile storage\nmedia. The current window that an NVM Set is operating in is configured by the host using the Predictable\nLatency Mode Window Feature or by the controller as a result of an autonomous action.\nTo remain in the Deterministic Window, the host is required to follow operating rules (refer to section\n8.1.20.1) ensuring that certain attributes do not exceed the typical or maximum values indicated in the\nPredictable Latency Per NVM Set log page. If the attributes exceed any of the typical or maximum values\nindicated in the Predictable Latency Per NVM Set log page or a Deterministic Excursion occurs, then the\nassociated NVM Set may autonomously transition to the Non-Deterministic Window. A Deterministic\nExcursion is a rare occurrence in the NVM subsystem that requires immediate action by the controller.\nThe host configures Predictable Latency Events to report using the Predictable Latency Mode Config\nfeature. The host may configure a Predictable Latency Event to be triggered when that value exceeds a\nspecific value in order to manage window changes and avoid autonomous transitions by the controller.\nRefer to section 8.1.20.3.\nIf Predictable Latency Mode is supported, then all controllers in the NVM subsystem shall:\n•\nSupport one or more NVM Sets;\n•\nSupport Read Recovery Levels;\n•\nSupport the Predictable Latency Mode log page for each NVM Set;\n•\nSupport the Predictable Latency Event Aggregate log page;\n•\nSupport the Predictable Latency Mode Config Feature;\n•\nSupport the Predictable Latency Mode Window Feature;\n•\nSupport Predictable Latency Event Aggregate Log Change Notices; and\n•\nIndicate support for Predictable Latency Mode in the Controller Attributes field in the Identify\nController data structure.",
