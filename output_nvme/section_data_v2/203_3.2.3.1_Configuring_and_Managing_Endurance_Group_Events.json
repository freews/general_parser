    "text": "The host may configure asynchronous events to be triggered when certain events occur for an Endurance\nGroup. The host submits a Set Features command specifying the Endurance Group Event Configuration\nfeature (refer to section 5.2.26.1.16), the Endurance Group, and the specific event(s) that shall trigger\nadding an entry to the Endurance Group Event Aggregate log page (refer to section 5.2.12.1.15).\nThe host configures events using a Set Features command for each Endurance Group.\nThe host submits a Set Features command specifying the Asynchronous Event Configuration feature (refer\nto section 5.2.26.1.5) with the Endurance Group Event Aggregate Log Change Notices bit set to ‘1’ to\nspecify that adding an entry to the Endurance Group Event Aggregate log page shall trigger an Endurance\nGroup Event Aggregate Log Page Change Notice event to the host (refer to Figure 428).\nThe host determines the Endurance Groups that have outstanding events by reading the Endurance Group\nEvent Aggregate log page. An entry is returned for each Endurance Group that has an event outstanding.\nThe host may use the Endurance Group Identifier Maximum value reported in the Identify Controller data\nstructure to determine the maximum size of this log page.\nTo determine the specific event(s) that have occurred for a reported Endurance Group, the host reads the\nEndurance Group Information log page (refer to Figure 222) for that Endurance Group. The Critical Warning\nfield indicates the event(s) that have occurred (e.g., that all namespaces in the Endurance Group have\nbeen placed in read-only mode). All events for an Endurance Group are cleared if the controller successfully\nprocesses a read for the Endurance Group Information log page for that Endurance Group, where the Get\nLog Page command has the Retain Asynchronous Event bit cleared to ‘0’. If the Critical Warning field in the\nEndurance Group Information log page is cleared to 0h, then events for that Endurance Group are not\nreported in the Endurance Group Event Aggregate log page.",
