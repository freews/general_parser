    "text": "A Centralized Discovery controller (CDC) may provide centralized access control services (i.e., Fabric\nZoning) for an NVMe-oF IP-based fabric. CDC-based Fabric Zoning provides a way to control the Discovery\nlog pages provided in response to a Get Log Page command issued to the CDC. Fabric Zoning should be\nbased on a Zoning database maintained by the CDC and containing two fundamental data structures: the\nZoneDBConfig and the ZoneDBActive, as shown in Figure 737.\nThe ZoneDBActive is a list of enforced ZoneGroups. The enforcement actions include:\n•\nDiscovery log page filtering;\n•\nDiscovery Log Page Change Asynchronous Event notifications (refer to section 8.3.2.4); and\n•\noptionally, network level restrictions (refer to section 8.3.2.3.5.2).\nThe abstract representation of the ZoneDBActive is shown in Figure 738.\nThe ZoneDBConfig is a list of configured ZoneGroups and ZoneAliases, as shown in Figure 739.",
