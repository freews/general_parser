    "text": "Figure 88 shows an example of a single domain NVM subsystem where the Media Units are NAND which\nis capable of being operated as QLC or at a lower density. The performance goal is for maximum bandwidth\nto a small NVM Set operating as SLC and to a larger NVM Set operating as QLC.\nThe Capacity Configuration Descriptor for this example contains two Endurance Group Configuration\nDescriptors. The first Endurance Group Configuration Descriptor for this example:\n•\nindicates a Capacity Adjustment Factor of approximately 400;\n•\ncontains one NVM Set Identifier; and\n•\ncontains four Channel Configuration Descriptors. Each Channel Configuration Descriptor contains\none Media Unit Configuration Descriptor.\nThe second Endurance Group Configuration Descriptor for this example:\n•\nindicates a Capacity Adjustment Factor of 100;\n•\ncontains one NVM Set Identifier; and\n•\ncontains four Channel Configuration Descriptors. Each Channel Configuration Descriptor contains\nthree Media Unit Configuration Descriptors.",
