    "text": "The Keep Alive capability uses the Keep Alive Timer on a controller as a watchdog timer to detect\ncommunication failures (e.g., transport failure, host failure, or controller failure) between a host and a\ncontroller. If the Keep Alive Timer feature is supported (i.e., the KAS field is set to a non-zero value (refer\nto Figure 328)), the controller shall support the Keep Alive command.\nThe term Keep Alive Timeout Time (KATT) refers to the time indicated by the value of the Keep Alive\nTimeout field on a controller (refer to Figure 416).\nThe NVMe Transport binding specification for the associated NVMe Transport defines:\n•\nthe minimum Keep Alive Timeout value, if any;\n•\nthe maximum Keep Alive Timeout value, if any; and\n•\nif the Keep Alive Timer feature is required to be supported and enabled.\nNVMe Transports that do not detect a connection loss in a timely manner shall require that the Keep Alive\nTimer feature be supported and enabled.",
