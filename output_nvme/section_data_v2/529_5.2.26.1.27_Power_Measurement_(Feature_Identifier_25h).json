    "text": "This Feature controls operation of the Power Measurement capability (refer to section 8.1.19.1).\nIf a Set Features command is issued specifying this Feature, then the attributes are specified in Command\nDword 11 (refer to Figure 454) and Command Dword 12 (refer to Figure 455). Completion queue entry\nDword 0 is defined in Figure 456.\nIf a Get Features command specifying this Feature is successfully completed, then the attributes described\nin Figure 456 are returned in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.\nThis Feature is not saveable (refer to Figure 199). The default value of this Feature shall be all bytes cleared\nto 0h. The current value of this Feature is persistent across power cycles and resets (refer to Figure 403).\nThe Action field in Command Dword 11 (refer to Figure 454) specifies whether the controller:\na) starts collecting interval power measurements for the Power Measurement log page;\nb) stops collecting interval power measurements for the Power Measurement log page; or\nc) performs a vendor specific action.\nRefer to section 8.1.19.1 for the usage of this Feature by the host.",
