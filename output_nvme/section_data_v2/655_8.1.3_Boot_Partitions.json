    "text": "Boot Partitions provide an optional area of NVM storage that may be read by the host without the host\ninitializing queues or enabling the controller. The simplified interface to access Boot Partitions may be used\nfor platform initialization code (e.g., a bootloader that is executed from host ROM) to boot to a pre-OS\nenvironment (e.g., UEFI) instead of storing the image on another non-volatile storage medium (e.g., SPI\nflash). Refer to section 8.1.3.1 for the procedure to read the contents of a Boot Partition.\nA controller that supports Boot Partitions has two Boot Partitions of equal size using Boot Partition identifiers\n0h and 1h. The two Boot Partitions allow the host to update one and verify the contents before marking the\nBoot Partition active. Controllers in the NVM subsystem may share the same Boot Partitions.\nThe contents of Boot Partitions are only modified using the Firmware Image Download and Firmware\nCommit commands (refer to section 8.1.3.2) and may be secured using either the Boot Partition Write\nProtection Config feature or the Replay Protected Memory Block to prevent unauthorized modifications\n(refer to section 8.1.3.3).",
