Any such text\nprocessing:\na) may occur as part of entry of UTF-8 strings into hosts and NVM subsystems as shown at points 1\nand 3 in Figure 141; and\nb) should not occur as part of receiving UTF-8 strings via NVMe, as shown at points 2 and 4 in Figure\n141.\nUpon entry into the host (e.g., via a configuration interface at point 1 in Figure 141, described as “input” in\nRFC 9562), a host may process a UTF-8 string (e.g., perform Unicode normalization). Upon entry into the\nNVM subsystem (e.g., via a configuration interface at point 3 in Figure 141, described as “input” in RFC\n9562), a controller may process a UTF-8 string (e.g., perform Unicode normalization). Upon receipt by the\nhost (e.g., at point 2 in Figure 141) of a UTF-8 string from the controller, text processing (e.g., Unicode\nnormalization) should not occur. Upon receipt by the controller (e.g., at point 4 in Figure 141) of a UTF-8\nstring from the host, text processing (e.g., Unicode normalization) should not occur.",
