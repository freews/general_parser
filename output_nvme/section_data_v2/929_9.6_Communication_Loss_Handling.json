    "text": "If the host loses communication with a controller, then the host is unable to receive a completion (CQE) for\nany outstanding command that has been submitted to that controller (refer to section 3.4.5). If the host is\nable to use another controller to access the same NVM subsystem or re-establish communication with the\noriginal controller, then it is strongly recommended that any host use of that controller to recover from\ncommunication loss follow the procedures and requirements in this section in order to avoid possible\ncorruption of user data and unintended changes to NVM subsystem state.\nHost recovery from communication loss with a controller consists of three functional components:\n•\nHost determination that communication with a controller has been lost is described in section 9.6.1.\n•\nHost determination that no further processing of outstanding commands is possible on that\ncontroller is described in section 9.6.2.\n•\nHost retry, if any, of outstanding commands after communication loss is described in section 9.6.3.\nThese functional components interact with each other. Host detection of communication loss is necessary\nbefore the host is able to determine when no further controller processing of outstanding commands is\npossible. Host retries of outstanding commands that modify user data or NVM subsystem state are able to\ncorrupt user data or make unintended changes to NVM subsystem state unless the host determines that\nno further controller processing of the original commands is possible as described in section 9.6.2.",
