    "text": "This Feature indicates the number of queues that the host requests for the controller processing the\ncommand. This Feature shall only be issued during initialization prior to creation of any I/O Submission\nand/or Completion Queues. If a Set Features command is issued for this Feature after creation of any I/O\nSubmission and/or I/O Completion Queues, then the Set Features command shall abort with status code\nof Command Sequence Error. The controller shall not change the value allocated between resets. For a\nSet Features command, the attributes are specified in Command Dword 11 (refer to Figure 472). For a Get\nFeatures command, Dword 11 is ignored.\nIf a Set Features or Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure\n473 are returned in Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.\nNote: The value allocated may be smaller or larger than the number of queues requested, often in virtualized\nimplementations. The controller may not have as many queues to allocate as are requested. Alternatively,\nthe controller may have an allocation unit of queues (e.g., power of two) and may supply more queues to\nthe host to satisfy its allocation unit.",

The controller should signal an interrupt when either the Aggregation Time or the Aggregation Threshold conditions are met. If either the Aggregation Time or the Aggregation Threshold fields are cleared to 0h, then an interrupt may be generated (i.e., interrupt coalescing is implicitly disabled). This Feature applies only to the I/O Queues. It is intended that interrupts for commands that complete in error are not coalesced. The settings are defined in Command Dword 11. | |"
