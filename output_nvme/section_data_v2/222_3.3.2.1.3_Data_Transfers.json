    "text": "Data may be transferred within capsules or by memory transfers. SGLs are used to specify the location of\ndata. Metadata, if transferred, is a contiguous part of the user data with which that metadata is associated.\nThe SGL descriptor(s) (refer to section 4.3.2) specify whether the command’s data is transferred through\nmemory or within the capsule. The capsule may contain either SGLs or data (not a mixture of both) following\nthe SQE. If additional SGLs are required, then the SGLs are included in the capsule immediately after the\nSQE. If an invalid offset is specified in an SGL descriptor, then a status code of SGL Offset Invalid shall be\nreturned.\nSGLs shall be supported within a capsule. The NVMe Transport binding specification defines the SGL\nDescriptor Types and Sub Types that are supported for the corresponding NVMe Transport. The NVMe\nTransport binding specification also specifies if SGLs may be supported in host memory.",
