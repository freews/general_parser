    "text": "An NVM Subsystem Shutdown initiates a shutdown of all controllers in a domain or NVM subsystem from\na single controller.\nInteractions between NVM Subsystem Shutdown and Power Loss Signaling processing are described in\nsection 8.2.5.\nA controller indicates support for the NVM Subsystem Shutdown Feature by setting the CAP.NSSS bit to\n‘1’ (refer to Figure 36).\nThe NVM Subsystem Shutdown Feature defined in this revision of the NVM Express Base Specification\nincludes some functionality that differs from the functionality of the NVM Subsystem Shutdown Feature\ndefined in revision 2.0 of the NVM Express Base Specification. A controller indicates support for these\nfunctionality differences by setting the NVM Subsystem Shutdown Enhancements Supported\n(CAP.NSSES) bit to ‘1’ (refer to Figure 36).\nIf a controller sets the CAP.NSSES bit to ‘1’, then while an NVM Subsystem Shutdown is reported as in\nprogress or is reported as complete (i.e., while the CSTS.ST bit is set to ‘1’ and the CSTS.SHST field is set\nto 01b or is set to 10b):\na. a Controller Reset initiates a Controller Level Reset (CLR) (refer to section 3.7.2); and\nb. the values of both the CSTS.ST bit and the CSTS.SHST field (refer to Figure 40) are not changed\nby a CLR initiated by any method other than an NVM Subsystem Reset.\nIf a controller clears the CAP.NSSES bit to ‘0’, then, as defined in revision 2.0 of the NVM Express Base\nSpecification:\na. while an NVM Subsystem Shutdown is reported as in progress or is reported as complete, a\nController Reset does not initiate a CLR (i.e., Controller Reset is disabled); and\nb. while an NVM Subsystem Shutdown is reported as complete, any CLR initiated by any transport-\nspecific reset type may clear the value of the CSTS.ST bit to ‘0’ and may clear the value of the\nCSTS.SHST field to 00b.\nA host is able to support NVM Subsystem Shutdown functionality both on controllers that set the\nCAP.NSSES bit to ‘1’ and on controllers that clear the CAP.NSSES bit to ‘0’ by ensuring that any NVM\nSubsystem Shutdown is followed by an NVM Subsystem Reset regardless of the value of the CSTS.ST bit\nand the value of the CSTS.SHST field.",
