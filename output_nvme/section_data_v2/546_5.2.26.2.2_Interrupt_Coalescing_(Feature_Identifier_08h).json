    "text": "This Feature configures controller configures interrupt coalescing settings. The controller should signal an\ninterrupt when either the Aggregation Time or the Aggregation Threshold conditions are met. If either the\nAggregation Time or the Aggregation Threshold fields are cleared to 0h, then an interrupt may be generated\n(i.e., interrupt coalescing is implicitly disabled). This Feature applies only to the I/O Queues. It is\nrecommended that interrupts for commands that complete in error are not coalesced. The settings are\nspecified in Command Dword 11.\nIf the controller detects that interrupts are already being processed for this vector, then the controller may\ndelay additional interrupts. Specifically, if the Completion Queue Head Doorbell property that is associated\nwith a particular interrupt vector is being updated, then the controller has a positive indication that\ncompletion queue entries are already being processed. In this case, the aggregation time and/or the\naggregation threshold may be reset/restarted upon the associated property write. This may result in\ninterrupts being delayed indefinitely in certain workloads where the aggregation time or aggregation\nthreshold is non-zero.\nIf a Get Features command is submitted for this Feature, the attributes specified in Figure 474 are returned\nin Dword 0 of the completion queue entry for that command.\nThis Feature is valid when the controller is configured for Pin Based, MSI, Multiple MSI or MSI-X interrupts.\nThere is no requirement for the controller to persist these settings if interrupt modes are changed. It is\nrecommended that the host re-issue this Feature after changing interrupt modes.",
