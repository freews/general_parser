If an authentication method is supported (refer to the AUS\nfield in Figure 285), then the FGUID field as defined in Figure 328 shall be supported.\nThe CDP Subsystem Unique String is shown in Figure 654. That string is used by the controller for deriving\nthe DHK that is unique to the NVM subsystem.\nThe DHK is derived using a keyed-hash authentication algorithm (refer to the CDPALG field in Figure 328),\nwhose output is the DHK that is stored in the NVM subsystem for subsequent usage during Personality\nUnfreeze Request operations (refer to section 8.1.6.2.1). The required DHK sizes are specified in Figure\n642.\nOnce the DHK has been successfully derived, the controller shall purge (refer to IEEE Std 2883) all copies\nof the key that was specified by the host for the Derived HMAC Key Programming operation.\nThe host should derive the DHK specified in Personality Unfreeze Request operations as described in this\nsection.\nThe DHK stored in the NVM subsystem shall be purged by the controller as part of the NVM subsystem\nbeing successfully configured with Manufacturing Default Personality.",
