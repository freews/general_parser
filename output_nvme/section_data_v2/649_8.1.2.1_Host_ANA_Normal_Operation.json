    "text": "The host determines if ANA is supported by examining the Asymmetric Namespace Access Reporting\nSupport (ANARS) bit in the CMIC field in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 328). The\nNSID or identifier (refer to section 4.5) is used to determine when multiple paths to the same namespace\nthat is not a dispersed namespace are available. For dispersed namespaces, globally unique namespace\nidentifiers (refer to section 8.1.10.2) are used to determine when multiple paths are available to the same\nnamespace, as described in section 8.1.10.5. The host examines the ANA log page (refer to section\n5.2.12.1.13) for each controller to determine the ANA state of each group of namespaces attached to that\ncontroller.\nTo send a command to a namespace, the host should select a controller that reports the ANA Optimized\nState (refer to section 8.1.1.4) and send the command to that controller. If more than one controller that\nreports the ANA Optimized state for a namespace are found, then the host may use all of those controllers\nto send commands.\nIf there are no controllers that report the ANA Optimized state for a namespace, then the host should select\na controller that reports ANA Non-Optimized State (refer to section 8.1.1.5) for that namespace and send\nthe command to that controller. If more than one controller that reports ANA Non-Optimized state for a\nnamespace are found, then the host may use all of those controllers to send commands.\nIf multiple controllers are being used, then the algorithm for determining which controller to use next is\noutside the scope of this specification (e.g., the host may select a simple round robin algorithm, a queue\ndepth weighted algorithm, a transfer length weighted algorithm, or any other algorithm).\nIf there are no controllers that report the ANA Optimized state for a namespace and there are no controllers\nthat report the ANA Non-Optimized state for that namespace, then the host should examine controllers that\nreport the ANA Inaccessible state as described in section 8.1.2.2.",
