    "text": "4.3.8.1 DataStore (M)  \nThe DataStore is a byte table. It can be used by the host for generic secure data storage. The DataStore table \nSHALL be at least 10MB in size (the Table table object that represents the DataStore table SHALL have a Rows \ncolumn value of at least 0x00A00000). The access control for modification or retrieval of data in the table initially \nrequires a member of the Admins class authority. These access control settings are personalizable. The Initial \nDataStore content value is VU. \n5 \nAppendix – SSC Specific Features \n5.1 Opal SSC-Specific Methods \n5.1.1 Activate – Admin Template SP Object Method \nActivate is an Opal SSC-specific method for managing the life cycle of SPs created in manufacturing (Manufactured \nSP), whose initial life cycle state is “Manufactured-Inactive”. The following pseudo-code is the signature of the \nActivate method (see [2] for more information). \nSPObjectUID.Activate[ ] \n=> \n[ ] \nActivate is an object method that operates on objects in the Admin SP’s SP table.  The TPer SHALL NOT permit \nActivate to be invoked on the SP objects of issued SPs. \nInvocation of Activate on an SP object that is in the “Manufactured-Inactive” state causes the SP to transition to the \n“Manufactured” state.  Invocation of Activate on an SP in any other life cycle state SHALL complete successfully \nprovided access control is satisfied, and have no effect.  The Activate method allows the TPer owner to “turn on” \nan SP that was created in manufacturing. \nThis method operates within a Read-Write session to the Admin SP.  The SP SHALL be activated immediately after \nthe method returns success if its invocation is not contained within a transaction. \nIn case of an “Activate Error” (see [4]), Activate SHALL fail with a status of FAIL. \nThe MethodID for Activate SHALL be 0x00 00 00 06 00 00 02 03. \n5.1.1.1 Activate Support \nSupport for Activate within transactions is (N), and the behavior of Activate within transactions is out of the scope \nof this specification. \nIf the Locking SP was created in manufacturing, and its Original Factory State is Manufactured-Inactive (see section \n5.2.2), support for Activate on the Locking SP’s object in the SP table is Mandatory. \n5.1.1.2 Side effects of Activate \nUpon successful activation of an SP that was in the “Manufactured-Inactive” state, the following changes SHALL be \nmade: \n• \nThe LifeCycleState column of SP’s object in the Admin SP’s SP table SHALL change to “Manufactured”. \n• \nThe current SID PIN (C_PIN_SID) in the Admin SP is copied into the PIN column of Admin1’s C_PIN credential \n(C_PIN_Admin1) in the activated SP.  This allows for taking ownership of the SP with a known PIN credential. \n• \nAny TPer functionality affected by the life cycle state of the SP based on the SP’s templates  is modified as \ndefined in the appropriate Template reference section of [2], and as defined in the “State transitions for \nManufactured SPs” section (see section 5.2.2.2) and “State behaviors for Manufactured SPs” section (see \nsection 5.2.2.3) of this specification. \n5.1.2 Revert – Admin Template SP Object Method \nRevert is an Opal SSC-specific method for managing the life cycle of SPs created in manufacturing (Manufactured \nSP). The following pseudo-code is the signature of the Revert method (see [2] for more information). \nSPObjectUID.Revert[ ] \n=> \n[ ] ",
