This allows for taking ownership of the SP with a known PIN credential. \n• \nAny TPer functionality affected by the life cycle state of the SP based on the SP’s templates  is modified as \ndefined in the appropriate Template reference section of [2], and as defined in the “State transitions for \nManufactured SPs” section (see section 5.2.2.2) and “State behaviors for Manufactured SPs” section (see \nsection 5.2.2.3) of this specification.",
