    "text": "Start of Informative Comment\nThe Opal SSC is an implementation profile for Storage Devices built to:\n• \nProtect the confidentiality of stored user data against unauthorized access once it leaves the owner’s control \n(following a power cycle and subsequent deauthentication) \n• \nEnable interoperability between multiple Storage Device vendors\nAn Opal SSC compliant Storage Device:\n• \nFacilitates feature discoverability \n• \nProvides some user definable features (e.g. access control, locking ranges, user passwords, etc.) \n• \nSupports Opal SSC unique behaviors (e.g. communication, table management)\nThis specification addresses a limited set of use cases. They are:\n• \nDeploy Storage Device & Take Ownership: the Storage Device is integrated into its target system and ownership \ntransferred by setting or changing the Storage Device’s owner credential. \n• \nActivate or Enroll Storage Device: LBA ranges are configured and data encryption and access control credentials \n(re)generated and/or set on the Storage Device. Access control is configured for LBA range unlocking. \n• \nLock & Unlock Storage Device: unlocking of one or more LBA ranges by the host and locking of those ranges \nunder host control via either an explicit lock or implicit lock triggered by a reset event. MBR shadowing provides \na mechanism to boot into a secure pre-boot authentication environment to handle device unlocking. \n• \nRepurpose & End-of-Life: erasure of data within one or more LBA ranges and reset of locking credential(s) for \nStorage Device repurposing or decommissioning.\nEnd of Informative Comment",
