    "text": "(see section 5.2.2.2.2).  As the only mandatory state for the Admin SP is Manufactured, the only mandatory transition \nis from Manufactured to Manufactured with the side effect of reverting the entire TPer to its Original Factory State.  \nSee section 5.1.2 for details. \nIf the Locking SP is a Manufactured SP, support for the “ANY STATE to ORIGINAL FACTORY STATE” transition (see \nsection 5.2.2.2.2) is Mandatory.  Specifically, support for the transition from Manufactured to either Manufactured-\nInactive or Manufactured is Mandatory, depending on the Locking SP’s Original Factory State.  This transition is \naccomplished via the Revert or RevertSP method (see sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.2.3). \nIf the Locking SP’s Original Factory State is Manufactured-Inactive, then support for the “Manufactured-Inactive to \nManufactured” transition (see section 5.2.2.2.1) is Mandatory.  This transition is accomplished via the Activate \nmethod (see section 5.1.1). \n5.2.2.2.1 Manufactured-Inactive to Manufactured \nTriggers: \n• \nThe Activate method (see section 5.1.1) is successfully invoked on the SP’s object in the Admin SP’s SP \ntable. \nSide effects: \n• \nThe value in the LifeCycleState column of the SP’s object in the Admin SP’s SP table changes to \nManufactured. \n• \nThe current SID PIN (C_PIN_SID) in the Admin SP is copied into the PIN column of Admin1’s C_PIN credential \n(C_PIN_Admin1) in the activated SP.  This allows taking ownership of the SP with a known PIN credential. \n• \nAny functionality enabled by the templates incorporated into the SP becomes active. \nWhen the Locking SP transitions from the Manufactured-Inactive state to the Manufactured state (via invocation of \nthe Activate method), the Storage Device SHALL NOT destroy any user data. \n5.2.2.2.2 ANY STATE to ORIGINAL FACTORY STATE \nTriggers: \n• \nRevert or RevertSP is successfully invoked on the SP. \nSide effects: \n• \nThe value in the LifeCycleState column of the SP’s object in the Admin SP’s SP table changes to the value of \nthe SP’s Original Factory State. \n• \nThe SP itself reverts to its Original Factory State, as described in sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3.  \n• \nIf the SP’s Original Factory State was Manufactured-Inactive, any functionality enabled by the templates \nincorporated into the SP becomes inactive.
