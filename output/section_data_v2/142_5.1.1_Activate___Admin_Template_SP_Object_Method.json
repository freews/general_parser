    "text": "5.1.1 Activate – Admin Template SP Object Method \nActivate is an Opal SSC-specific method for managing the life cycle of SPs created in manufacturing (Manufactured \nSP), whose initial life cycle state is “Manufactured-Inactive”. The following pseudo-code is the signature of the \nActivate method (see [2] for more information). \nSPObjectUID.Activate[ ] \n=> \n[ ] \nActivate is an object method that operates on objects in the Admin SP’s SP table.  The TPer SHALL NOT permit \nActivate to be invoked on the SP objects of issued SPs. \nInvocation of Activate on an SP object that is in the “Manufactured-Inactive” state causes the SP to transition to the \n“Manufactured” state.  Invocation of Activate on an SP in any other life cycle state SHALL complete successfully \nprovided access control is satisfied, and have no effect.  The Activate method allows the TPer owner to “turn on” \nan SP that was created in manufacturing. \nThis method operates within a Read-Write session to the Admin SP.  The SP SHALL be activated immediately after \nthe method returns success if its invocation is not contained within a transaction. \nIn case of an “Activate Error” (see [4]), Activate SHALL fail with a status of FAIL. \nThe MethodID for Activate SHALL be 0x00 00 00 06 00 00 02 03.
