    "text": "5.1.3.2 KeepGlobalRangeKey parameter (Locking Template-specific) \nThe Optional KeepGlobalRangeKey parameter is a Locking Template-specific parameter. This parameter provides \na mechanism for the Locking SP to be “turned off” without eradicating the media encryption key for the Global Locking \nRange.  This allows the Locking SP to be disabled without causing removal of the user data associated with the Global \nLocking Range. \nWhen this parameter is present and set to True, the TPer SHALL NOT erase data associated with the Global Locking \nRange after the Locking SP transitions to the “Manufactured-Inactive” state even if the valid value is set to the \nActiveDataRemovalMechanism parameter in DataRemovalMechanism table. \nIf the Global Range is either Read Unlocked or Write Unlocked at the time of invocation of RevertSP, then the \nTPer SHALL comply with the request to keep the user data associated with the Global locking range and the Global \nRange’s media encryption key. \nIf the Global Range is Read Locked and Write Locked then invocation of the RevertSP method with the \nKeepGlobalRangeKey parameter set to True SHALL fail with status FAIL, and the SP SHALL NOT change life cycle \nstates. \nIf the Locking SP was created in manufacturing, support for the KeepGlobalRangeKey parameter is Mandatory for \nthe Locking SP. \nThe parameter number for KeepGlobalRangeKey SHALL be 0x060000.
