    "text": "See section 5.1.2.2.1 for the effects of the Revert method upon the PIN column value of the \nC_PIN_SID object.   \no \nAll issued SPs SHALL be deleted, and all Manufactured SPs SHALL revert to Original Factory State. \nManufactured SPs in the “Manufactured-Inactive” life cycle state SHALL NOT be affected. \n• \nAny TPer functionality affected by the life cycle state of the SP based on the templates incorporated into it is \nmodified as defined in the appropriate Template reference section of [2], and as defined in the “State \ntransitions for Manufactured SPs” section (see section 5.2.2.2) and “State behaviors for Manufactured SPs” \nsection (see section 5.2.2.3) of this specification. \nStart of Informative Comment \nUnless already in the Manufactured-Inactive life cycle state, reverting the Locking SP will cause the media encryption \nkeys to be eradicated, which has the side effect of securely erasing all data in the User LBA portion of the Storage \nDevice. \nEnd of Informative Comment \n5.1.2.2.1 Effects of Revert on the PIN Column Value of C_PIN_SID \nWhen Revert is successfully invoked on the SP object for the Admin SP (UID = 0x00 00 02 05 00 00 00 01), \nthe PIN column value of the C_PIN_SID object SHALL be affected as follows: \n1. If the SID authority has never been successfully authenticated, then the C_PIN_SID PIN column SHALL \nremain at its current value. \n2. If the SID authority has previously been successfully authenticated, then: \na) If the value of the “Behavior of C_PIN_SID PIN upon TPer Revert” field in the Opal SSC V2 feature \ndescriptor is 0x00, then the C_PIN_SID PIN column SHALL be set to the PIN column value of the \nC_PIN_MSID object.  Additionally, the “Initial C_PIN_SID PIN Indicator” field SHALL be set to 0x00 \nupon completion of the Revert. \nb) If the value of the “Behavior of C_PIN_SID PIN upon TPer Revert” field in the Opal SSC V2 feature \ndescriptor is not 0x00, then the C_PIN_SID PIN column SHALL be set to a vendor unique (VU) value. \nStart of Informative Comment \nIn the case where the “Initial C_PIN_SID PIN Indicator” and “Behavior of C_PIN_SID PIN upon TPer Revert” fields \nare both 0x00, the above rules for Revert are backward compatible with Opal v1.00. \nEnd of Informative Comment ",
