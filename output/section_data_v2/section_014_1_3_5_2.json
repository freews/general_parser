Each list item shall start with a lowercase letter followed by a \nclose parenthesis. If it is necessary to subdivide a list item further with an additional unordered list (i.e., have a nested \nunordered list), then the nested unordered list shall be indented and each item in the nested unordered list shall start \nwith an uppercase letter followed by a close parenthesis. \nThe following is an example of an unordered list with a nested unordered list: \nEXAMPLE - The following are the items for the assembly: \na) a box containing: \nA) a bolt; \nB) a nut; and \nC) a washer; \nb) a screwdriver; and \nc) a wrench.
