The TPer SHALL revert the SP immediately after the \nmethod is successfully invoked outside of a transaction.  Upon completion of reverting the SP, the TPer SHALL report \nstatus of the method invocation if invoked outside of a transaction, and then immediately abort the session.  The TPer \nMAY prepare a CloseSession method for retrieval by the host to indicate that the session has been aborted. \nThe MethodID for RevertSP SHALL be 0x00 00 00 06 00 00 00 11. ",
