    "text": "TCG Storage Security Subsystem Class (SSC): Opal  |  Version 2.30  |  1/30/2025  |  PUBLISHED \nPage 16 \n© TCG 2025 \n2 Opal SSC Overview \n2.1 Opal SSC Use Cases and Threats \nStart of Informative Comment \nThe Opal SSC is an implementation profile for Storage Devices built to: \n• \nProtect the confidentiality of stored user data against unauthorized access once it leaves the owner’s control \n(following a power cycle and subsequent deauthentication) \n• \nEnable interoperability between multiple Storage Device vendors \nAn Opal SSC compliant Storage Device: \n• \nFacilitates feature discoverability \n• \nProvides some user definable features (e.g. access control, locking ranges, user passwords, etc.) \n• \nSupports Opal SSC unique behaviors (e.g. communication, table management) \nThis specification addresses a limited set of use cases. They are: \n• \nDeploy Storage Device & Take Ownership: the Storage Device is integrated into its target system and ownership \ntransferred by setting or changing the Storage Device’s owner credential. \n• \nActivate or Enroll Storage Device: LBA ranges are configured and data encryption and access control credentials \n(re)generated and/or set on the Storage Device. Access control is configured for LBA range unlocking. \n• \nLock & Unlock Storage Device: unlocking of one or more LBA ranges by the host and locking of those ranges \nunder host control via either an explicit lock or implicit lock triggered by a reset event. MBR shadowing provides \na mechanism to boot into a secure pre-boot authentication environment to handle device unlocking. \n• \nRepurpose & End-of-Life: erasure of data within one or more LBA ranges and reset of locking credential(s) for \nStorage Device repurposing or decommissioning.  \nEnd of Informative Comment \n2.2 Security Providers (SPs) \nAn Opal SSC compliant Storage Device SHALL support at least two Security Providers (SPs): \n1) Admin SP \n2) Locking SP \nThe Locking SP MAY be created by the Storage Device manufacturer. \n2.3 Interface Communication Protocol \nAn Opal SSC compliant Storage Device SHALL implement the synchronous communications protocol as defined in \nSection 3.3.4. \nThis communication protocol operates based upon configuration information defined by:  \n1) the values reported via Level 0 Discovery (see section 3.1.1);  \nThe combination of the host's communication properties and the TPer's communication properties (see section \n4.1.1.1).
