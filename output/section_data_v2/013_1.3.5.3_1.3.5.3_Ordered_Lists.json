Each\nlisted item starts with a Western-Arabic numeral followed by a close parenthesis. If it is necessary to subdivide a list\nitem further with an additional unordered list (i.e., have a nested unordered list), then the nested unordered list shall\nbe indented and each item in the nested unordered list shall start with an uppercase letter followed by a close\nparenthesis.\nThe following is an example of an ordered list with a nested unordered list:\nEXAMPLE - The following are the instructions for the assembly:\n1) remove the contents from the box;\n2) assemble the item;\nA) use a screwdriver to tighten the screws; and\nB) use a wrench to tighten the bolts;\nand\n3) take a break.",
