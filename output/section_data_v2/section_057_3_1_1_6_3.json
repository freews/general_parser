The TPer SHALL support the \nCrypto Erase mechanism and MAY support the Overwrite Data Erase or Block Erase or other mechanisms. The \nTPer MAY support multiple Data Removal Mechanisms described in Table 10. After a RevertSP method has \ncompleted without an error, the condition of user data SHALL be indicated as specified in Table 10. \nTable 10 - Supported Data Removal Mechanism ",

Further this mechanism SHALL be executed in addition to any other supported data removal mechanism that is being executed. <br> <br> This bit MAY be used by the Revert or the RevertSP or the GenKey (band erase) mechanisms of data removal, where the cryptographic keys used to encrypt the user data are changed. |\n| 3-4 | Reserved | Reserved |\n| 5 | Vendor Specific Erase¹ | The Vendor Specific Erase mechanisms cause all user data to be removed by a vendor specific method. ³ |\n| 6-7 | Reserved | |\n| | | |\n| Notes: | | |\n| | | ¹ The cryptographic erase operation SHALL also be performed when any of the other data removal mechanisms are used. |\n| | | ² The Cryptographic Erase bit may be used by the Revert, the RevertSP or the GenKey operations (band erase). Any subsequent operation(s) such as Deallocate, or Unmap, or Trim, that is part of the implementation of the data removal operation SHALL be accounted for in the time reported for this operation (see section 3.1.1.6.4). The time value reported SHALL correspond to the estimated completion time of the Cryptographic Erase. For the erase (GenKey) operation, the reported estimated time value will correspond to the estimated completion time of the erase operation, regardless of the extent of the range being erased. |\n| | | ³ If a Storage Device supports more than one vendor proprietary method of data removal, then the associated estimated time value will represent the completion time for the longest vendor specific erase mechanism of data removal, then the associated estimated time value will represent the completion time for the longest of the vendor specific mechanisms. |"
