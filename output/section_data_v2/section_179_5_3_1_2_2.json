    "text": "5.3.1.2.2 Byte Tables \nFor rows in the Table table that pertain to byte tables, the RecommendedAccessGranularity column indicates the \nrecommended access granularity (in bytes) for the Set and Get method for the table described in these rows of the \nTable table. The RecommendedAccessGranularity column indicates the alignment of data for the Set and Get \nmethod that allows for optimal Set/Get performance. \nIf the TPer does not have a recommended alignment for the byte table described in a row of the Table table, then \nits RecommendedAccessGranularity column SHALL be set to one. \nWhen the host invokes the Set method on a byte table, if ValidRecommendedGranularity (see Figure 5) is False, \nthen the performance of the TPer MAY be reduced when processing the method. \nFigure 5 - ValidRecommendedGranularity definition for Set \nFor the Set method: \n   ValidRecommendedGranularity is True if \n              a) (x modulo RecommendedAccessGranularity) = 0 \n                  and \n              b) (y modulo RecommendedAccessGranularity) = 0 \nwhere: \n   x =  the start offset of the Set method  \n            (i.e., the value of the Where parameter) \n   y = the number of data bytes being set  \n            (i.e., the length of the Values parameter) \nWhen the host invokes the Get method on a byte table, if ValidRecommendedGranularity (see Figure 6) is False, \nthen the performance of the TPer MAY be reduced when processing the method. \nFigure 6 - ValidRecommendedGranularity definition for Get \nFor the Get method: \n   ValidRecommendedGranularity is True if \n              a) (x modulo RecommendedAccessGranularity) = 0 \n                  and \n              b) (y modulo RecommendedAccessGranularity) = 0 \nwhere: \n   x =  the start offset of the Get method  \n            (i.e., the value of the startRow component of the Cellblock parameter) \n   y = the number of data bytes being retrieved  \n            (i.e., the difference of the endRow and startRow components of the \n            Cellblock parameter, plus one) ",
