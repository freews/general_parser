If the SID authority has never been successfully authenticated, then the C_PIN_SID PIN column SHALL\nremain at its current value. \n2. If the SID authority has previously been successfully authenticated, then: \na) If the value of the “Behavior of C_PIN_SID PIN upon TPer Revert” field in the Opal SSC V2 feature\ndescriptor is 0x00, then the C_PIN_SID PIN column SHALL be set to the PIN column value of the\nC_PIN_MSID object.  Additionally, the “Initial C_PIN_SID PIN Indicator” field SHALL be set to 0x00\nupon completion of the Revert. \nb) If the value of the “Behavior of C_PIN_SID PIN upon TPer Revert” field in the Opal SSC V2 feature\ndescriptor is not 0x00, then the C PIN SID PIN column SHALL be set to a vendor unique (VU) value.\nStart of Informative Comment\nn the case where the “Initial C_PIN_SID PIN Indicator” and “Behavior of C_PIN_SID PIN upon TPer Revert” fields\nare both 0x00, the above rules for Revert are backward compatible with Opal v1.00.\nEnd of Informative Comment",
