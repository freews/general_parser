    "text": "5.1.3.3 Effects of RevertSP \nUpon successful invocation of the RevertSP method, the following changes SHALL be made: \n• \nIf the KeepGlobalRangeKey parameter is not present or set to False, then successful invocation of the \nRevertSP method on the Locking SP or Admin SP SHALL cause user data removal as defined by the \nActiveDataRemovalMechanism (see Table 33) and cause the media encryption keys to be eradicated, which \nhas the side effect of securely erasing all data in the User LBA portion of the Storage Device. \n• \nIf the KeepGlobalRangeKey parameter is set to True, then successful invocation of the RevertSP method \non the Locking SP SHALL cause user data removal as defined by the ActiveDataRemovalMechanism (see \nTable 33) and cause all media encryption keys to be eradicated except for the Global Range’s media \nencryption key (K_AES_{128,256}_GlobalRange_Key). \n• \nInteractions with interface commands during the processing of the RevertSP method are defined in [4]. \nIf any TCG reset occurs prior to completing user data removal and the eradication of media encryption keys in the \nStorage Device, then the operation SHALL be aborted and the Locking SP SHALL NOT revert to its Original Factory \nState.  \nStart of Informative Comment \nIf any TCG reset occurs during the processing of the RevertSP method, the result of user data removal is undefined. \nEnd of Informative Comment \nUpon completion of user data removal and the eradication of media encryption keys in the Storage Device, the \nfollowing changes SHALL be made: \n• \nThe row in the Admin SP’s SP table that represents the Locking SP SHALL revert to its original factory value. \n• \nThe Locking SP itself SHALL revert to its Original Factory State.  While reverting to its Original Factory State, \nthe TPer SHALL erase all personalization of the SP, and return the personalized values to their Original \nFactory State values.  The mechanism for erasure of personalization implementation-specific.   \n• \nAny TPer functionality affected by the life cycle state of the SP based on the templates incorporated into it is \nmodified as defined in the appropriate Template reference section of [2], and as defined in the “State \ntransitions for Manufactured SPs” section (see section 5.2.2.2) and “State behaviors for Manufactured SPs” \nsection (see section 5.2.2.3) of this specification. \nStart of Informative Comment \nReverting the Locking SP will cause the media encryption keys to be eradicated (except for the GlobalRange key if \nthe KeepGlobalRangeKey parameter is present and set to True), which has the side effect of securely erasing all \ndata in the User LBA portion of the Storage Device. \nEnd of Informative Comment ",
