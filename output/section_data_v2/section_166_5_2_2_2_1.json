    "text": "Manufactured” transition (see section 5.2.2.2.1) is Mandatory.  This transition is accomplished via the Activate \nmethod (see section 5.1.1). \n5.2.2.2.1 Manufactured-Inactive to Manufactured \nTriggers: \n• \nThe Activate method (see section 5.1.1) is successfully invoked on the SP’s object in the Admin SP’s SP \ntable. \nSide effects: \n• \nThe value in the LifeCycleState column of the SP’s object in the Admin SP’s SP table changes to \nManufactured. \n• \nThe current SID PIN (C_PIN_SID) in the Admin SP is copied into the PIN column of Admin1’s C_PIN credential \n(C_PIN_Admin1) in the activated SP.  This allows taking ownership of the SP with a known PIN credential. \n• \nAny functionality enabled by the templates incorporated into the SP becomes active. \nWhen the Locking SP transitions from the Manufactured-Inactive state to the Manufactured state (via invocation of \nthe Activate method), the Storage Device SHALL NOT destroy any user data.
