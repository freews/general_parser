Manufactured-Inactive: This is the Original Factory State for SPs that are created in manufacturing, where it is \nnot desired for the functionality of that SP to be active when the TPer is shipped.  All templates that exist in an SP \nthat is in the Manufactured-Inactive state SHALL be counted in the Instances column of the appropriate objects \nin the Admin SP’s Template table.  Sessions cannot be opened to SPs in the Manufactured-Inactive state.  Only \nSPs whose Original Factory State was Manufactured-Inactive can return to the Manufactured-Inactive state. \n2. Manufactured: This is the standard operational state of a Manufactured SP, and defines the initial required access \ncontrol settings of an SP based on the Templates incorporated into the SP, prior to personalization. \nThe Manufactured state is Mandatory for the Admin SP. \nTCG Storage Security Subsystem Class (SSC): Opal \nTCG Storage Security Subsystem Class (SSC): Opal  |  Version 2.30  |  1/30/2025  |  PUBLISHED \nPage 96 \n© TCG 2025 ",
