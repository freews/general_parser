5.1.3.2 KeepGlobalRangeKey parameter (Locking Template-specific) 
The Optional KeepGlobalRangeKey parameter is a Locking Template-specific parameter. This parameter provides 
a mechanism for the Locking SP to be “turned off” without eradicating the media encryption key for the Global Locking 
Range.  This allows the Locking SP to be disabled without causing removal of the user data associated with the Global 
Locking Range. 
When this parameter is present and set to True, the TPer SHALL NOT erase data associated with the Global Locking 
Range after the Locking SP transitions to the “Manufactured-Inactive” state even if the valid value is set to the 
ActiveDataRemovalMechanism parameter in DataRemovalMechanism table. 
If the Global Range is either Read Unlocked or Write Unlocked at the time of invocation of RevertSP, then the 
TPer SHALL comply with the request to keep the user data associated with the Global locking range and the Global 
Range’s media encryption key. 
If the Global Range is Read Locked and Write Locked then invocation of the RevertSP method with the 
KeepGlobalRangeKey parameter set to True SHALL fail with status FAIL, and the SP SHALL NOT change life cycle 
states. 
If the Locking SP was created in manufacturing, support for the KeepGlobalRangeKey parameter is Mandatory for 
the Locking SP. 
The parameter number for KeepGlobalRangeKey SHALL be 0x060000.
