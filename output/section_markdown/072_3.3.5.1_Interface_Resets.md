Interface resets that generate TCG reset events are defined in [4]. 
Interface initiated TCG reset events SHALL result in: 
1. All open sessions SHALL be aborted; 
2. All uncommitted transactions SHALL be aborted; 
3. All pending session startup activities SHALL be aborted; 
4. All TCG command and response buffers SHALL be invalidated; 
5. All related method processing SHALL be aborted; 
6. For each ComID, the state of the synchronous protocol stack SHALL transition to “Awaiting IF-SEND” state; 
7. No notification of these events SHALL be sent to the host.
