1.3.5.2 Unordered Lists 
An unordered list is one in which the order of the listed items is unimportant (i.e., it does not matter where in the list 
an item occurs as all items have equal importance). Each list item shall start with a lowercase letter followed by a 
close parenthesis. If it is necessary to subdivide a list item further with an additional unordered list (i.e., have a nested 
unordered list), then the nested unordered list shall be indented and each item in the nested unordered list shall start 
with an uppercase letter followed by a close parenthesis. 
The following is an example of an unordered list with a nested unordered list: 
EXAMPLE - The following are the items for the assembly: 
a) a box containing: 
A) a bolt; 
B) a nut; and 
C) a washer; 
b) a screwdriver; and 
c) a wrench.
