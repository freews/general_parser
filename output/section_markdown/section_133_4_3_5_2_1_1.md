4.3.5.2.1.1 RangeStart Behavior 
This column value defines the starting LBA value for this range. In non-Global Range rows, this column MAY be 
modifiable based on access control settings. Changes to this column are subject to the same constraints and 
checks defined for this column when rows of the Locking table are created (see [2]). 
When processing a Set method or CreateRow method on the Locking table for a non-Global Range row, if: 
a) 
the AlignmentRequired column in the LockingInfo table is TRUE;  
b) 
RangeStart is non-zero; and 
c) 
StartAlignment (see Figure 1) is non-zero,  
then the method SHALL fail and return an error status code INVALID_PARAMETER. 
Figure 1 - StartAlignment Calculation 
StartAlignment = (RangeStart - LowestAlignedLBA) modulo AlignmentGranularity  
where:  
LowestAlignedLBA and AlignmentGranularity are columns in the LockingInfo table (see 
section 4.3.5.1)
