5.1.2 Revert – Admin Template SP Object Method 
Revert is an Opal SSC-specific method for managing the life cycle of SPs created in manufacturing (Manufactured 
SP). The following pseudo-code is the signature of the Revert method (see [2] for more information). 
SPObjectUID.Revert[ ] 
=> 
[ ] 
Revert is an object method that operates on objects in the Admin SP’s SP table.  The TPer SHALL NOT permit 
Revert to be invoked on the SP objects of issued SPs. 
Invoking Revert on an SP object causes the SP to revert to its Original Factory State. This method allows the TPer 
owner (or TPer manufacturer, if access control permits and the Maker authorities are enabled) to remove the SP 
owner’s ownership of the SP and revert the SP to its Original Factory State. 
Invocation of Revert is permitted on Manufactured SPs that are in any life cycle state.  Successful invocation of 
Revert on a Manufactured SP that is in the Manufactured-Inactive life cycle state SHALL have no effect on the SP. 
This method operates within a Read-Write session to the Admin SP.  The TPer SHALL revert the SP immediately 
after the method is successfully invoked outside of a transaction.  If Revert is invoked on the Admin SP’s object in 
the SP table, the TPer SHALL abort the session immediately after reporting status of the method invocation if invoked 
outside of a transaction.  The TPer MAY prepare a CloseSession method for retrieval by the host to indicate that 
the session has been aborted.  
The MethodID for Revert SHALL be 0x00 00 00 06 00 00 02 02.
