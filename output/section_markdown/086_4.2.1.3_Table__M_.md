Start of Informative Comment 
[2] states, “The Table table in the Admin SP includes a row for each table that the TPer supports, in addition to a row 
for each table that exists in the Admin SP.”  However, the Opal SSC requires only the tables from the Admin SP to be 
included in the Admin SP’s Table table, as indicated in Table 20.
