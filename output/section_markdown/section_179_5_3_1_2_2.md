5.3.1.2.2 Byte Tables 
For rows in the Table table that pertain to byte tables, the RecommendedAccessGranularity column indicates the 
recommended access granularity (in bytes) for the Set and Get method for the table described in these rows of the 
Table table. The RecommendedAccessGranularity column indicates the alignment of data for the Set and Get 
method that allows for optimal Set/Get performance. 
If the TPer does not have a recommended alignment for the byte table described in a row of the Table table, then 
its RecommendedAccessGranularity column SHALL be set to one. 
When the host invokes the Set method on a byte table, if ValidRecommendedGranularity (see Figure 5) is False, 
then the performance of the TPer MAY be reduced when processing the method. 
Figure 5 - ValidRecommendedGranularity definition for Set 
For the Set method: 
   ValidRecommendedGranularity is True if 
              a) (x modulo RecommendedAccessGranularity) = 0 
                  and 
              b) (y modulo RecommendedAccessGranularity) = 0 
where: 
   x =  the start offset of the Set method  
            (i.e., the value of the Where parameter) 
   y = the number of data bytes being set  
            (i.e., the length of the Values parameter) 
When the host invokes the Get method on a byte table, if ValidRecommendedGranularity (see Figure 6) is False, 
then the performance of the TPer MAY be reduced when processing the method. 
Figure 6 - ValidRecommendedGranularity definition for Get 
For the Get method: 
   ValidRecommendedGranularity is True if 
              a) (x modulo RecommendedAccessGranularity) = 0 
                  and 
              b) (y modulo RecommendedAccessGranularity) = 0 
where: 
   x =  the start offset of the Get method  
            (i.e., the value of the startRow component of the Cellblock parameter) 
   y = the number of data bytes being retrieved  
            (i.e., the difference of the endRow and startRow components of the 
            Cellblock parameter, plus one)
