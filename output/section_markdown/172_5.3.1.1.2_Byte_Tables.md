5.3.1.1.2 Byte Tables 
For rows in the Table table that pertain to byte tables, the MandatoryWriteGranularity column indicates the mandatory 
access granularity (in bytes) for the Set method for the table described in these rows of the Table table. The 
MandatoryWriteGranularity column indicates the alignment requirement for both the access start offset (the Where 
parameter) and length (number of bytes in the Values parameter). 
The value of the MandatoryWriteGranularity column SHALL be less than or equal to the value in the 
RecommendedAccessGranularity column in the same row of the Table table.  
The value of MandatoryWriteGranularity SHALL be less than or equal to 8192.  
When the host invokes the Set method on a byte table, if ValidMandatoryGranularity (see Figure 4) is False, then the 
method SHALL fail with status INVALID_PARAMETER. 
If the TPer does not have a requirement on mandatory alignment for the byte table described in a row of the Table 
table, then its MandatoryWriteGranularity column SHALL be set to one.  
Figure 4 - ValidMandatoryGranularity definition 
For the Set method: 
   ValidMandatoryGranularity is True if 
              a) (x modulo MandatoryWriteGranularity) = 0 
                  and 
              b) (y modulo MandatoryWriteGranularity) = 0 
where: 
   x =  the start offset of the Set method  
            (i.e., the value of the Where parameter) 
   y = the number of data bytes being set  
            (i.e., the length of the Values parameter)
