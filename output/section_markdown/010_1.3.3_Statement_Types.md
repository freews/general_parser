1.3.3 Statement Types 
Please note a very important distinction between different sections of text throughout this document. There are two 
distinctive kinds of text: informative comment and normative statements.  
Because most of the text in this specification will be of the kind normative statements, the authors have informally 
defined it as the default and, as such, have specifically called out text of the kind informative comment. They have 
done this by flagging the beginning and end of each informative comment and highlighting its text in gray.  
This means that unless text is specifically marked as of the kind informative comment, it can be considered a kind of 
normative statements.   
EXAMPLE: Start of Informative Comment 
This is the first paragraph of 1–n paragraphs containing text of the kind informative comment ... 
This is the second paragraph of text of the kind informative comment ... 
This is the nth paragraph of text of the kind informative comment ... 
To understand the TCG specification the user must read the specification. (This use of MUST does not require any 
action). 
End of Informative Comment
