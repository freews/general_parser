5.2.2.1 State definitions for Manufactured SPs 
1. Manufactured-Inactive: This is the Original Factory State for SPs that are created in manufacturing, where it is 
not desired for the functionality of that SP to be active when the TPer is shipped.  All templates that exist in an SP 
that is in the Manufactured-Inactive state SHALL be counted in the Instances column of the appropriate objects 
in the Admin SP’s Template table.  Sessions cannot be opened to SPs in the Manufactured-Inactive state.  Only 
SPs whose Original Factory State was Manufactured-Inactive can return to the Manufactured-Inactive state. 
2. Manufactured: This is the standard operational state of a Manufactured SP, and defines the initial required access 
control settings of an SP based on the Templates incorporated into the SP, prior to personalization. 
The Manufactured state is Mandatory for the Admin SP.
