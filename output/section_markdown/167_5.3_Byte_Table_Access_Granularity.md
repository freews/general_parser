5.3 Byte Table Access Granularity 
Start of Informative Comment 
While the general architecture defined in [2] allows data to be written into byte tables starting at any arbitrary byte 
boundary and with any arbitrary byte length, certain types of Storage Devices work more efficiently when data is 
written aligned to a larger block boundary.  This section defines extensions to [2] that allow a Storage Device to report 
the restrictions that it enforces when the host invokes the Set method on byte tables.
