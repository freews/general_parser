5.1.2.3 Interrupted Revert 
The Revert method and complete implementation of necessary background operations MAY be aborted due to any 
reset condition, including power loss.   
When interrupted, the Data Removal Operation Interrupted bit SHALL be set to one in the Level 0 Discovery – 
Supported Data Removal Mechanism feature descriptor appropriately as defined in section 3.1.1.6.2. 
Further, the return status value of the Revert method does not mean that all necessary operations, such as the 
background deallocate, or trim, or un-map are complete.
