3.3.4.1.3 Payload Error Response 
The TPer SHALL respond according to the following rules if it encounters a streaming protocol violation:  
• 
If the error is on Session Manager or is such that the TPer cannot resolve a valid session ID from the payload 
(i.e. errors in the ComPacket header or Packet header), then the TPer SHALL discard the payload and 
immediately transition to the “Awaiting IF-SEND” state. 
• 
If the error occurs after the TPer has resolved the session ID, then the TPer SHALL abort the session and MAY 
prepare a CloseSession method for retrieval by the host.
