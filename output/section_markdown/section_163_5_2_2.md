The state diagram for Manufactured SPs is shown in Figure 3.

Start of Informative Comment 
The LockingSP’s OFS could be either the Manufactured-Inactive or the Manufactured state. The Manufactured-to-
Manufactured optional state transition may occur when the LockingSP’s OFS is the Manufactured state. In an 
implementation where the LockingSP’s OFS is the Manufactured state, then the Revert method would revert the 
LockingSP from Manufactured back to Manufactured while still reverting all LockingSP tables back to the OFS. 
End of Informative Comment 
Additional state transitions may exist depending on the states supported by the Storage Device and the SP’s Original 
Factory State.  Invoking Revert or RevertSP (see sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.2.3) on the SP will cause the SP to 
transition back to its Original Factory State.  
The Original Factory State of the Admin SP SHALL be Manufactured. The only state that is Mandatory for the Admin 
SP is Manufactured. 
If the Locking SP is a Manufactured SP, then its Original Factory State SHALL be Manufactured-Inactive.   
If the Locking SP is a Manufactured SP, then support for the states of Manufactured and Manufactured-Inactive are 
mandatory. 
The other states in the state diagram are beyond the scope of this document.
