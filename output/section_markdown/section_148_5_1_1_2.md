5.1.1.2 Side effects of Activate 
Upon successful activation of an SP that was in the “Manufactured-Inactive” state, the following changes SHALL be 
made: 
• 
The LifeCycleState column of SP’s object in the Admin SP’s SP table SHALL change to “Manufactured”. 
• 
The current SID PIN (C_PIN_SID) in the Admin SP is copied into the PIN column of Admin1’s C_PIN credential 
(C_PIN_Admin1) in the activated SP.  This allows for taking ownership of the SP with a known PIN credential. 
• 
Any TPer functionality affected by the life cycle state of the SP based on the SP’s templates  is modified as 
defined in the appropriate Template reference section of [2], and as defined in the “State transitions for 
Manufactured SPs” section (see section 5.2.2.2) and “State behaviors for Manufactured SPs” section (see 
section 5.2.2.3) of this specification.
