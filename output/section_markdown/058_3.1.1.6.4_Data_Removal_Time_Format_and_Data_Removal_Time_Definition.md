3.1.1.6.4 Data Removal Time Format and Data Removal Time Definition 
Each Data Removal Time field provides the worst case estimate of the time required to perform the erasure 
corresponding to each Data Removal Mechanism defined in the Supported Data Removal Mechanism field. The 
Data Removal Time Format bit identifies the format used to express the time as follows: 
a) if the Data Removal Time Format bit is set to zero, then the estimated time is defined in Table 11; and 
b) if the Data Removal Time Format bit is set to one, then the estimated time is defined in Table 12. 
The Data Removal Time Format bit and Data Removal Time Format field are defined in Table 11 and Table 12. 
Table 11 - Data Removal Time (Data Removal Time Format bit= 0) 
Table 12 - Data Removal Time (Data Removal Time Format bit= 1) 
Start of Informative Comment 
Each Data Removal Time field gives an estimate of the total time required to perform the erasure for each 
corresponding Data Removal Mechanism. This field is not a dynamic estimate of the remaining time for completion. 
When GenKey is performed on a range that’s less than the global range, the time needed for the completion of the 
operation can be less than the time reported for the operation.  The reported estimated time for the data removal 
operation will be for the entire capacity of the Storage Device.  The host software can use the ratio of the band size 
to the entire capacity of the Storage Device, to derive the estimated time for erasing a band.
