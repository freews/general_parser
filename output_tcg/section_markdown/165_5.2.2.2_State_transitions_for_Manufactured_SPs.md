##### 5.2.2.2 State transitions for Manufactured SPs

> **Section ID**: 5.2.2.2 | **Page**: 97-97

The following sections describe the Mandatory and Optional state transitions for Opal SSC-compliant
Manufactured SPs.
For the Admin SP, the only transition for which support is mandatory is “ANY STATE to ORIGINAL FACTORY STATE”
(see section 5.2.2.2.2).  As the only mandatory state for the Admin SP is Manufactured, the only mandatory transition
is from Manufactured to Manufactured with the side effect of reverting the entire TPer to its Original Factory State.
See section 5.1.2 for details.
If the Locking SP is a Manufactured SP, support for the “ANY STATE to ORIGINAL FACTORY STATE” transition (see
section 5.2.2.2.2) is Mandatory.  Specifically, support for the transition from Manufactured to either Manufactured-
Inactive or Manufactured is Mandatory, depending on the Locking SP’s Original Factory State.  This transition is
accomplished via the Revert or RevertSP method (see sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.2.3).
If the Locking SP’s Original Factory State is Manufactured-Inactive, then support for the “Manufactured-Inactive to
Manufactured” transition (see section 5.2.2.2.1) is Mandatory.  This transition is accomplished via the Activate
method (see section 5.1.1).
