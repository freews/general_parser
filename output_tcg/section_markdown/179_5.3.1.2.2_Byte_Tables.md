###### 5.3.1.2.2 Byte Tables

> **Section ID**: 5.3.1.2.2 | **Page**: 100-100

For rows in the Table table that pertain to byte tables, the RecommendedAccessGranularity column indicates the
recommended access granularity (in bytes) for the Set and Get method for the table described in these rows of the
Table table. The RecommendedAccessGranularity column indicates the alignment of data for the Set and Get
method that allows for optimal Set/Get performance.
If the TPer does not have a recommended alignment for the byte table described in a row of the Table table, then
its RecommendedAccessGranularity column SHALL be set to one.
When the host invokes the Set method on a byte table, if ValidRecommendedGranularity (see Figure 5) is False,
then the performance of the TPer MAY be reduced when processing the method.
When the host invokes the Get method on a byte table, if ValidRecommendedGranularity (see Figure 6) is False,
then the performance of the TPer MAY be reduced when processing the method.
