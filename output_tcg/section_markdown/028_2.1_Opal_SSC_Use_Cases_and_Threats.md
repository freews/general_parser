### 2.1 Opal SSC Use Cases and Threats

> **Section ID**: 2.1 | **Page**: 17-17

The Opal SSC is an implementation profile for Storage Devices built to:
•
Protect the confidentiality of stored user data against unauthorized access once it leaves the owner’s control
(following a power cycle and subsequent deauthentication)
•
Enable interoperability between multiple Storage Device vendors
An Opal SSC compliant Storage Device:
•
Facilitates feature discoverability
•
Provides some user definable features (e.g. access control, locking ranges, user passwords, etc.)
•
Supports Opal SSC unique behaviors (e.g. communication, table management)
This specification addresses a limited set of use cases. They are:
•
Deploy Storage Device & Take Ownership: the Storage Device is integrated into its target system and ownership
transferred by setting or changing the Storage Device’s owner credential.
•
Activate or Enroll Storage Device: LBA ranges are configured and data encryption and access control credentials
(re)generated and/or set on the Storage Device. Access control is configured for LBA range unlocking.
•
Lock & Unlock Storage Device: unlocking of one or more LBA ranges by the host and locking of those ranges
under host control via either an explicit lock or implicit lock triggered by a reset event. MBR shadowing provides
a mechanism to boot into a secure pre-boot authentication environment to handle device unlocking.
•
Repurpose & End-of-Life: erasure of data within one or more LBA ranges and reset of locking credential(s) for
Storage Device repurposing or decommissioning.
