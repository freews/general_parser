#### 3.3.1 Communication Properties

> **Section ID**: 3.3.1 | **Page**: 29-29

The TPer SHALL support the minimum communication buffer size as defined in section 4.1.1.1. For each ComID, the
physical buffer size SHALL be reported to the host via the Properties method.
The TPer SHALL terminate any IF-SEND command whose transfer length is greater than the reported
MaxComPacketSize size for the corresponding ComID. For details, refer to “Invalid Transfer Length parameter on IF-
SEND” in [4].
Data generated in response to methods contained within an IF-SEND command payload subpacket (including the
required ComPacket / Packet / Subpacket overhead data) SHALL fit entirely within the response buffer. If the
method response and its associated protocol overhead do not fit completely within the response buffer, the TPer
1) SHALL terminate processing of the IF-SEND command payload,
2) SHALL NOT return any part of the method response if the Sync Protocol is being used, and
3) SHALL return an empty response list with a TCG status code of RESPONSE_OVERFLOW in that method’s
response status list.
