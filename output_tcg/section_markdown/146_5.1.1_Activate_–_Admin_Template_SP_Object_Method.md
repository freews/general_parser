#### 5.1.1 Activate – Admin Template SP Object Method

> **Section ID**: 5.1.1 | **Page**: 91-91

Activate is an Opal SSC-specific method for managing the life cycle of SPs created in manufacturing (Manufactured
SP), whose initial life cycle state is “Manufactured-Inactive”. The following pseudo-code is the signature of the
Activate method (see [2] for more information).
Activate is an object method that operates on objects in the Admin SP’s SP table.  The TPer SHALL NOT permit
Activate to be invoked on the SP objects of issued SPs.
Invocation of Activate on an SP object that is in the “Manufactured-Inactive” state causes the SP to transition to the
“Manufactured” state.  Invocation of Activate on an SP in any other life cycle state SHALL complete successfully
provided access control is satisfied, and have no effect.  The Activate method allows the TPer owner to “turn on”
an SP that was created in manufacturing.
This method operates within a Read-Write session to the Admin SP.  The SP SHALL be activated immediately afte
the method returns success if its invocation is not contained within a transaction.
In case of an “Activate Error” (see [4]), Activate SHALL fail with a status of FAIL.
The MethodID for Activate SHALL be 0x00 00 00 06 00 00 02 03.
