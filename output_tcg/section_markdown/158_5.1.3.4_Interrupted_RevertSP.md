> **Section ID**: 5.1.3.4 | **Page**: 95-95

The RevertSP method and complete implementation of the necessary background operations MAY be aborted due
to any reset condition, including power loss.
When interrupted, the Data Removal Operation Interrupted bit SHALL be set to one in the Level 0 Discovery –
Supported Data Removal Mechanism feature descriptor appropriately as defined in section 3.1.1.6.2.
Further, the return status value of the RevertSP method does not mean that all necessary operations such as the
data removal operation are complete.
