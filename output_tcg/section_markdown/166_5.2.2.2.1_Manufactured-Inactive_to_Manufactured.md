###### 5.2.2.2.1 Manufactured-Inactive to Manufactured

> **Section ID**: 5.2.2.2.1 | **Page**: 97-97

Triggers:
•
The Activate method (see section 5.1.1) is successfully invoked on the SP’s object in the Admin SP’s SP
table.
Side effects:
•
The value in the LifeCycleState column of the SP’s object in the Admin SP’s SP table changes to
Manufactured.
•
The current SID PIN (C_PIN_SID) in the Admin SP is copied into the PIN column of Admin1’s C_PIN credential
(C_PIN_Admin1) in the activated SP.  This allows taking ownership of the SP with a known PIN credential.
•
Any functionality enabled by the templates incorporated into the SP becomes active.
When the Locking SP transitions from the Manufactured-Inactive state to the Manufactured state (via invocation o
the Activate method), the Storage Device SHALL NOT destroy any user data.
