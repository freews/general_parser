### 5.4 Examples of Alignment Geometry Reporting

> **Section ID**: 5.4 | **Page**: 100-101

Figure 7 illustrates reporting for a typical legacy Storage Device where there is one logical block per physical block
on the media.
Figure 8 illustrates geometry for a Storage Device where there are 8 logical blocks per physical block (e.g., a 4K
physical block) and the first logical block is aligned at the beginning of the first physical block.
Figure 9 illustrates geometry for a Storage Device where there are 8 logical blocks per physical block (e.g., a 4K
physical block) and LBA=1 is the first logical block that is aligned at the beginning of a physical block
Figure 10 illustrates geometry for a Storage Device where there are 2000 logical blocks per physical block and
LBA=1234 is the first logical block that is aligned at the beginning of a physical block.
