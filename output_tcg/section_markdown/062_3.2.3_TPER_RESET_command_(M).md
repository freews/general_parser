#### 3.2.3 TPER_RESET command (M)

> **Section ID**: 3.2.3 | **Page**: 28-29

If the TPER_RESET command is enabled, it SHALL cause the following before the TPer accepts the next IF-SEND
or IF-RECV command:
a) all dynamically allocated ComIDs SHALL return to the Inactive state;
b) all open sessions SHALL be aborted on all ComIDs;
c) all uncommitted transactions SHALL be aborted on all ComIDs;
d) the synchronous protocol stack for all ComIDs SHALL be reset to its initial state
e) all TCG command and response buffers SHALL be invalidated for all ComIDs;
f)
all related method processing occurring on all ComIDs SHALL be aborted;
g) The TPer’s knowledge of the host’s communications capabilities, on all ComIDs, SHALL be reset to the
initial minimum assumptions defined in [2] or the TPer’s SSC definition;
h) the values of the ReadLocked and WriteLocked columns SHALL be set to True for all Locking SP’s Locking
objects that contain the Programmatic enumeration value in the LockedOnReset column;
i)
the value of the Done column of the Locking SP’s MBRControl table SHALL be set to False, if the
DoneOnReset column contains the Programmatic enumeration value.
The TPER_RESET command is delivered by the transport IF-SEND command. If the TPER_RESET command is
enabled, the TPer SHALL accept and acknowledge it at the interface level. If the TPER_RESET command is disabled,
the TPer SHALL abort it at the interface level with the “Other Invalid Command Parameter” status (see [4]). There is
no IF-RECV response to the TPER_RESET command.
The TPER_RESET command is defined in Table 13.
The Transfer Length SHALL be non-zero. All data transferred SHALL be ignored.
