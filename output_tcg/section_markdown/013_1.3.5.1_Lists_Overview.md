##### 1.3.5.1 Lists Overview

> **Section ID**: 1.3.5.1 | **Page**: 13-13

Lists are associated with an introductory paragraph or phrase, and are numbered relative to that paragraph or phrase
(i.e., all lists begin with an a) or 1) entry).
Each item in a list is preceded by identification with the style of the identification being determined by whether the lis
is intended to be an ordered list or an unordered list.
If the item in a list is not a complete sentence, the first word in the item is not capitalized. If the item in a list is a
complete sentence, the first word in the item is capitalized.
Each item in a list ends with a semicolon, except the last item, which ends in a period. The next to the last entry in the
list ends with a semicolon followed by an “and” or an “or” (i.e., “…; and”, or “…; or”). The “and” is used if all the items
in the list are required. The “or” is used if only one or more items in the list are required.
