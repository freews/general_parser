#### 5.2.2 Manufactured SP Life Cycle States

> **Section ID**: 5.2.2 | **Page**: 96-96

The state diagram for Manufactured SPs is shown in Figure 3.
The LockingSP’s OFS could be either the Manufactured-Inactive or the Manufactured state. The Manufactured-to-
Manufactured optional state transition may occur when the LockingSP’s OFS is the Manufactured state. In an
implementation where the LockingSP’s OFS is the Manufactured state, then the Revert method would revert the
LockingSP from Manufactured back to Manufactured while still reverting all LockingSP tables back to the OFS.
Additional state transitions may exist depending on the states supported by the Storage Device and the SP’s Original
Factory State.  Invoking Revert or RevertSP (see sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.2.3) on the SP will cause the SP to
transition back to its Original Factory State.
The Original Factory State of the Admin SP SHALL be Manufactured. The only state that is Mandatory for the Admin
SP is Manufactured.
f the Locking SP is a Manufactured SP, then its Original Factory State SHALL be Manufactured-Inactive.
If the Locking SP is a Manufactured SP, then support for the states of Manufactured and Manufactured-Inactive are
mandatory.
The other states in the state diagram are beyond the scope of this document.
