###### 4.3.5.2.1.2 RangeLength Behavior

> **Section ID**: 4.3.5.2.1.2 | **Page**: 87-88

This column value defines the quantity of contiguous LBAs for this LBA range (starting with the value defined in the
RangeStart column). In non-Global Range rows, this column MAY be modifiable based on access control settings.
Changes to this column are subject to the same constraints and checks defined for this column when rows of the
Locking table are created (see [2]).
When processing a Set method or CreateRow method on the Locking table for a non-Global Range row, if:
a)
the AlignmentRequired column in the LockingInfo table is TRUE;
b)
RangeLength is non-zero; and
c)
LengthAlignment (see Figure 2) is non-zero,
n the method SHALL fail and return an error status code INVALID PARAMETER.
If RangeStart is zero, then
LengthAlignment = (RangeLength - LowestAlignedLBA) modulo AlignmentGranularity
If RangeStart is non-zero, then
LengthAlignment = (RangeLength modulo AlignmentGranularity)
where:
LowestAlignedLBA and AlignmentGranularity are columns in the LockingInfo table (see
section 4.3.5.1)
