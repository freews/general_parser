are not locked, the Storage Device SHALL either:
•
Process the data transfer as defined in [2], if Range Crossing Behavior bit is set to zero (in Level 0 Discovery
Opal SSC V2 Feature, see section 3.1.1.5)

•
Terminate the command with “Other Invalid Command Parameter” as defined in [4],
if Range Crossing Behavior bit is set to one (in Level 0 Discovery Opal SSC V2 Feature, see section
