##### 1.3.5.3 Ordered Lists

> **Section ID**: 1.3.5.3 | **Page**: 13-13

An ordered list is one in which the order of the listed items is important (i.e., item n is required before item n+1). Each
listed item starts with a Western-Arabic numeral followed by a close parenthesis. If it is necessary to subdivide a list
item further with an additional unordered list (i.e., have a nested unordered list), then the nested unordered list shall
be indented and each item in the nested unordered list shall start with an uppercase letter followed by a close
parenthesis.
The following is an example of an ordered list with a nested unordered list:
