    "text": "Upon successful invocation of the Revert method, the following changes SHALL be made:\n•\nIf the Locking SP is not in the “Manufactured-Inactive” life cycle state, then successful invocation of the\nRevert method on the Locking SP or Admin SP SHALL cause user data removal as defined by the\nActiveDataRemovalMechanism (see Table 33) and cause the media encryption keys to be eradicated, which\nhas the side effect of securely erasing all data in the User LBA portion of the Storage Device.\n•\nIf the Locking SP is in the “Manufactured-Inactive” life cycle state, then successful invocation of the Revert\nmethod on the Locking SP SHALL NOT cause user data removal in the Storage Device.\nInteractions with interface commands during the processing of the Revert method are defined in [4].\nIf any TCG reset occurs prior to completing user data removal and the eradication of all media encryption keys in the\nStorage Device, then the Revert operation SHALL be aborted and the Locking SP SHALL NOT revert to its Original\nFactory State.\nIf any TCG reset occurs during the processing of the Revert method, the result of user data removal is undefined\nand the TPer does not erase personalization of the Locking SP. For example, the PIN column value for each row in\nC_PIN table is unchanged.\nUpon completion of user data removal and the eradication of all media encryption keys in the Storage Device, or if\nthe Locking SP is in the “Manufactured-Inactive” life cycle state, the following changes SHALL be made:\n•\nThe row in the Admin SP’s SP table that represents the invoked SP SHALL revert to its original factory values\n•\nThe SP itself SHALL revert to its Original Factory State.  While reverting to its Original Factory State, the TPer\nSHALL securely erase all personalization of the SP, and return personalized values to their Original Factory\nState values.  The mechanism for erasure of personalization is implementation-specific.\n•\nWhen the Revert method is successfully invoked on the SP object for the Admin SP (UID = 0x00 00 02\n05 00 00 00 01), the entire TPer SHALL revert to its Original Factory State, including:\nAll Admin SP personalization with the exception of the PIN column value of the C_PIN_SID object.\nSee section 5.1.2.2.1 for the effects of the Revert method upon the PIN column value of the\nC_PIN_SID object.\nAll issued SPs SHALL be deleted, and all Manufactured SPs SHALL revert to Original Factory State.\nManufactured SPs in the “Manufactured-Inactive” life cycle state SHALL NOT be affected.\n•\nAny TPer functionality affected by the life cycle state of the SP based on the templates incorporated into it is\nmodified as defined in the appropriate Template reference section of [2], and as defined in the “State\ntransitions for Manufactured SPs” section (see section 5.2.2.2) and “State behaviors for Manufactured SPs”\nsection (see section 5.2.2.3) of this specification.\nUnless already in the Manufactured-Inactive life cycle state, reverting the Locking SP will cause the media encryption\nkeys to be eradicated, which has the side effect of securely erasing all data in the User LBA portion of the Storage\nDevice.",
