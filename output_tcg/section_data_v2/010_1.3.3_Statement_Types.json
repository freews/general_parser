There are two\ndistinctive kinds of text: informative comment and normative statements.\nBecause most of the text in this specification will be of the kind normative statements, the authors have informally\ndefined it as the default and, as such, have specifically called out text of the kind informative comment. They have\ndone this by flagging the beginning and end of each informative comment and highlighting its text in gray.\nThis means that unless text is specifically marked as of the kind informative comment, it can be considered a kind o\nnormative statements.\nThis is the first paragraph of 1–n paragraphs containing text of the kind informative comment ...\nThis is the second paragraph of text of the kind informative comment ...\nThis is the nth paragraph of text of the kind informative comment ...\nTo understand the TCG specification the user must read the specification. (This use of MUST does not require any\naction).",
