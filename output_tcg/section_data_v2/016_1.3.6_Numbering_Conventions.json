    "text": "g\nA binary number is represented in this specification by any sequence of digits consisting of only the Western-Arabic\nnumerals 0 and 1 immediately followed by a lowercase b (e.g., 0101b). Underscores or spaces may be included\nbetween characters in binary number representations to increase readability or delineate field boundaries\n(e.g., 0 0101 1010b or 0_0101_1010b).\nA hexadecimal number is represented in this specification by any sequence of digits consisting of only the Western-\nArabic numerals 0 through 9 and/or the uppercase English letters A through F immediately preceded by “0x”.\nUnderscores or spaces may be included between characters in hexadecimal number representations to increase\nreadability or delineate field boundaries (e.g., 0xFD8C FA23 or 0x0B_FD8C_FA23). Hexadecimal numbers are in\nCourier New font.\nA decimal number is represented in this specification by any sequence of digits consisting of only the Western-Arabic\nnumerals 0 through 9 not immediately followed by a lowercase b or lowercase h (e.g., 25). This specification uses the\nfollowing conventions for representing decimal numbers:\na) the decimal separator (i.e., separating the integer and fractional portions of the number) is a period;\nb) the thousands separator (i.e., separating groups of three digits in a portion of the number) is a space; and\nc) the thousands separator is used in both the integer portion and the fraction portion of a number.\nA decimal number represented in this specification with an overline over one or more digits following the decimal point\nis a number where the overlined digits are infinitely repeating (e.g., 666.6ത Error! Bookmark not defined.means\n666.666 666… or 666 2/3, and 12.142857\nതതതതതതതതതത means 12.142 857 142 857… or 12 1/7).",
